ninis-deli-chicago,Joseph N.,"Holy shit! I mean, sorry for the language but damn, this place made my year. Let me set the stage:  super snowy day (8"" and counting today) and I decided it was the perfect day to look for a spot outside the hood. I ran a quick search for reasonably priced restaurants, sorted by top rated, and this spot came up number one, even though it's not easy to get to from Diversey and Sheffield.

I digress. I'm not sure I've been to a restaurant more deserving of a pristine rating than this place. After drudging my way through the snow to get here, I see it: a small building on the corner, pained pink with Nini's written on it. (Nice Cuban touch)

Upon entering, the interior wall is likewise painted in bright colors. Love it. Music: on point. How perfect that Chan Chan was playing. The menu is written in pink and blue, and really pops! Everything was very clean, and this place just feels alive!!

I walk to the counter to order the media noche, but before I can, I'm greeted by Juan: an incredibly jovial and warm young man, part of the family who owns the restaurant. ""Hey brotha, how are you? Have you tried our food before?"" He then explains the Cuban/Mexican fusion of the menu and recommends the kitchen sink, which combines everything I was considering. I'm sold! He also recommends their Cafe con leche, which I also order. 

I cannot impress enough through words how friendly and inviting Juan is. He asks my name, tells me his, gets excited when I take his recommendation, and it's not fake customer service, Juan just loves living this dream. That's the stuff that makes repeat customers.

Bill comes to $16.50, which at this point I'm happy to fork over. Juan thanks me so much for coming in and making the trek all the way from Lincoln Park /Lakeview.

Next, Juan makes me this dream of a beverage (the Cafe con leche) and sprinkles cinnamon on top. It's just great. He also asks if I want water for my table, and I get a wine bottle of water and a cup.

As I'm waiting for my sandwich, 12 people come into the restaurant (there were 6, including me, when I arrived... And this is at 3, so off peak hours for sure). Apparently everyone knew about this hot spot but me!

Food comes out: damn. Just DAMN! Juan says ""alright Joe, here is your Kitchen Sink!"" It is a sight for hungry eyes, and is very generous, portion-wise (see photo). After putting down half, I decide against finishing the whole thing, in part because I'm just about full, but also this means I get to eat the other half later, maybe share it with my girlfriend to get her hooked.

Music keeps kicking, great Cuban sound. Juan keeps being genuinely kind and excited with every customer. Cheers erupt when he brings a table of 7 their plantain appetizer.

Juan asks me how everything was, and I can't tell him everything running through my mind... That this is the type of restaurant that transports you to a Utopia when you enter.

I decide to order dessert:  At the counter, Juan starts calling me ""Joe Joe,"" and I realize I'm a part of the family. Juan recommends the guava and goat cheese empanada, and again it didn't disappoint.

People always ask me what my favorite spot in Chicago is, and I reply that I try new spots all the time, so don't have one. This may very well be that place. If my experience on my next trip is anything close to this one, I'll crown Nini's king."
ninis-deli-chicago,Jasmine D.,"GO. This cute little family-owned joint is worth checking out and definitely worth supporting. Encased in pink walls and stamped with a stellar logo, it isn't that hard to miss. You walk in, order, and are then ASSIGNED a seat. (My friend and I were told firmly, but not rudely, to order first--we didn't order right away because she had to take a phone call.) We were greeted at the counter by the owners' son, who was enthralled to tell us about the family business. He told us excitedly about his family's roots and how they were the inspiration for the food. My friend and I split a lot of different menu items. The overall consensus was that everything was good and reasonably priced.

Media Noche ($9): large portions, the flavors were excellent and the crunch and bite of the pickle was fantastic.

Flamin' hot elote ($4): just okay--it wasn't heavily slathered with all the ingredients like your typical street elote and I would've wanted more flamin' hots encrusted onto my corn. Moreover, because I went during the winter, the corn wasn't huge. Not sure if it was worth the $4 price tag.

Sweet empanada ($3.50): perfect little treat. The accompanying sauce wasn't even needed.

Churro ($2.50): small churro drizzled with cajeta. Good, but nothing too special.

Caf√© con leche ($4): Insta-worthy and delicious. 

Hibiscus lemonade ($4): not a huge fan generally, but it was good--not too sweet and not watered down."
ninis-deli-chicago,K J.,"Just go. The food is awesome, a crowd favorite is the ropa vieja (put sriracha on that baby oh my god), but I love the media noche as well! The guava jelly is awesome with the eggs, and the crunchy texture of the bread completes every single bite. 

You'll see a lot of hypebeasts walking into Nini's. Don't be intimidated if you're not wearing street brands or if you've got a different style - Juany and the team will still treat you as hospitable as possible. 

It's pricey for the portion sizes but when I factor in the hospitality, respect, and energy of the place, I'm happy to pay those dollars. 

And yeah they got a pink wall for photos if you're basic like that."
ninis-deli-chicago,Amy H.,"Nicest welcome I have ever received at a restaurant. This neighborhood gem is perfect. Family run and they so obviously care. The chicken empanada is delicious, especially with their homemade cucumber salsa. My daughter loves their El Cubaniti sandwich...vegetarian version. Love their cafe latte, as well. Yum."
ninis-deli-chicago,Sylvia O.,"Juan welcomed me in with his bright smile and enthusiasm.  He asked me if I'd ever dined with them before, and when I said no, he gave me the full history of the shop and recommended certain items on the menu for me based on my dietary restrictions. I got the Cubanito with no cheese and also got the homemade hibiscus lemonade. Cuban music wafts through the speakers and you can't help but tap your feet as you wait for your food to arrive. 

Nini's is the kind of food that after you take the first bite, you are already trying to decide how you can ration the meal so that the whole experience can last as long as possible. I mean, every bite had me wanting to high five someone. Juan also brought over some chipotle mayo and salsa verde for me to add to the sandwich.  I have already been back a second time for their sandwich with guava jelly and mustard, and I will go back again for the churros and whatever else I can get from the menu. Juan even recognized me the second time I went back, which just goes to show how customer focused this place is.

If you go early before 11, there usually isn't a long wait, but there was a line by the time I left at 11, so plan ahead! Get thee to Nini's. You won't regret one bite. The portions are huge!"
ninis-deli-chicago,Julia A.,"My experience was absolute. Juan greeted me upon entry... his entire customer service interaction with me was actually top notch. I tried their media noche sandwich - a perfect combination of breakfast and lunch, which is exactly what I craved at the moment. I'm looking forward to exploring their menu further next time.

P.S. Love the pink wall outside. Such a perfect photo opp!"
ninis-deli-chicago,Kici C.,"ATTENTION IT TEAM: CAN WE GRANT AN HONORARY SIXTH STAR FOR THIS PLACE!? 

Wow. To be quite honest, I'm a bit speechless about my experience at Nini's this afternoon. I was really craving some cafe con leche and found this place on Yelp. First things first, the customer service is felt the moment you walk in the door. Everyone was so warm and friendly it honestly was very refreshing. I wish I could've gotten the cashiers name but he was so friendly and warm that not only did I get the cafe con leche that I came for but I also tried the chicken empanadas and the special of the day which was flaming hot cheetos covered elote. 

Man...everything was amazing. I feel like good customer service amplifies the entire food experience and I can't tell you a single problem I had with my food. Super tasty and super quick. My meal came to about $13 which isn't bad for what I had. I left feeling energized, full and ready to come back for more cafe con leche!!! 

God. If any of the employees of Ninis are reading this: I love you and want you to cater my wedding. Goodness! God bless ya!"
ninis-deli-chicago,Colleen B.,"Oh my gosh...Nini's. I cannot even rave enough about this amazing Cuban deli. My sister lives right down the street, so we decided to give this place a try for lunch.

Firstly, the place is adorable. Very clean inside with great decor. The owner takes all orders and is the most personable person. You can tell he truly loves this place and providing quality food for his customers. The staff even call you personally by name when checking on you throughout your meal. Just top notch service.

My sister and I chose to split the guava and goat cheese empanada. I then ordered the El Cubanito and my sister ordered the Kitchen Sink (combo of their 3 sandwiches). The guava and goat cheese empanada was the perfect crispiness and was served with a side mango sauce. 

In regards to the sandwiches, just WOW. The Cubanito consisted of smoked ham, avocado, egg, cheese, black beans and topped with a sweep plantain. It was grilled to perfection. Truly amazing!! The sandwich is quite large, so I was able to take half home. My sister raved about her sandwich, as well.

Overall, this place is just fabulous. I could eat here every day! Please support this local place in Noble Square!"
ninis-deli-chicago,Amy O.,"This little place is tucked off of a main street. It's been family owned for a while and they keep updating it which is nice. It's colorful inside and has a very ""instagram-able"" wall outside. Food was superb. Drinks were amazing. The owners son is usually there; he's very friendly and genuinely wants to make sure you have a good time. The menu appears to be rotating and it's generally just a few items; which usually means those few will be really good. Overall: a must see."
ninis-deli-chicago,Trisha A.,"Hands down one of my favorite places in Chicago! 

Came here for the pink wall, stayed for Juan and the amazing menu, and currently planning my next visit.

My friends raved about this place and I had to try it for myself. 

When me and K got to the front of the line, Juan probably knew we were first-timers haha. He welcomed us and ran us through the menu, finishing off with the specials. Based on a friend's suggestion (and the delicious description), we both ordered the Ropa Vieja burrito. We also got the tostones, hibiscus lemonade, and mango-pineapple juice topped with strawberries. 

Ropa Vieja- omg wow. So good! The combo was great, especially that egg and cheese part. Drool. 

Tostones- good amount for the price ($3.50). The dipping sauce was also on point. 

Drinks- aesthetically pleasing, sweet (but not too sweet), refreshing. Love! 

Lastly, I had to get the horchata paleta. Damn, that was good. 

Sorry this is not the most detailed review but just go lol. You won't regret it."
ninis-deli-chicago,Kathy M.,Happiest guy I've ever met working behind the counter. You can tell he loves what he does and the food that he serves! I had the burrito and a hibiscus lemonade and they were both excellent! We will definitely return!
ninis-deli-chicago,Melissa C.,I took my original reviews down due to someone's not liking it and passive aggressiveness. When I post reviews it isn't to be malicious or in an attempt to sabotage. My honest opinion is this place is for yuppies. It isn't authentic and it's overpriced.  The spices are lacking severely. The El Cubanito had zero flavor. The only potential was the thin slice of turkey I added for an additional fee. The empanada was lacking flavor as well. I just didn't like it all. And when I spend $17 I think I deserve something worthwhile. Won't be back.
ninis-deli-chicago,Daniel W.,"Nini's Deli is a prime example of what needs to be done to run an exemplary Mom and Pop restaurant. From the food, the service, the marketing, etc... I was very impressed. I ordered the Kitchen Sink which was a slew of all the meats I believe sandwiched between avocado slices, homemade chipotle aioli, and fitting bread. It was delicious. 

What I came away impressed with was the passion that poured out of the owner's heart for Nini's. I forget his name (my B) but he was very energetic and enthusiastic about the menu there while explaining the different items. Super personable and even gave me a try of their homemade hibiscus lemonade since it was my first visit. His energy/enthusiasm is contagious and is much needed when trying to make it out there as a mom and pop. I appreciated it very much and I will certainly be back. Maybe tonight...?"
ninis-deli-chicago,Nazish C.,"Food here is AMAZING. Their sandwiches are so good and remind me of my times in Miami. While the coffee can't beat authentic Cuban coffee you get from Miami, it comes close. 

I recommend the empanadas. They're incredible! 
Only downside is that seating is super limited so you have to have one person sit down while everyone orders. 

I'll definitely be back."
ninis-deli-chicago,Tam N.,"This mom and pop shop is doing it right. As Juan, the son of the owners, explained, the food has cuban-mexican influences.

My group ordered:
-Plantains that came with 3 different dipping sauces $3.50
-Media Noche $8.50
-Ropa vieja burrito $9
-Their monthly (?) special of a monte carlo
-Cafe con leche $3.50
-Hibiscus lemonade $3.50

The plantains were just okay. I used them as a medium for the 3 sauces, my favorite being the chipotle ailoi. The sandwiches were of generous proportions. We all just ate half of it for lunch and had the other half for another meal. This definitely made the price worth paying for. I traded half of my burrito for the media noche and it was delicious heated up in my toaster oven. I will say, there was definitely too much ham to bread ratio in the sandwich. Which was fine since I could easily take it out to enjoy with my morning eggs. 

The cafe con leche was definitely on the pretty sweet side (just how i like it) so if you want it less sweet, definitely mention that. It tasted just like a vietnamese coffee to me. The hibiscus lemonade was worth trying once but I wouldn't get it again. 

Overall, I'm happy to return to support this mom and pop shop. 

There's plenty of free parking around the neighborhood. And I definitely always will appreciate the system of ordering upfront, grabbing a seat, then being brought your food."
ninis-deli-chicago,Andrea L.,"Nini's doesn't have a big menu, but that's okay because what they have is delicious.

My friend introduced me to this place and I'm glad I got to check it out. We got one sandwich and one empanada, as well as the party sized hibiscus lemonade to share. I enjoyed it all but the highlight for me would have to be the lemonade. I normally don't like lemonade but this was very refreshing without tasting sickly sweet or extremely sour.

The place is cutely decorated and service is also excellent!"
ninis-deli-chicago,Amy C.,"Juan, the son of the owners of Nini's Deli invited me to come back and try some food after my disappointment with my first experience. Honestly, I couldn't have asked for a better second experience. 

The moment I introduced myself, Juan greeted me with the biggest and warmest smile. He was super enthusiastic and couldn't have been more sweet. He told my sister and I a little about Nini's Deli and his parents - father from Cuba and mother from Mexico. Nini's Deli has a great combination of food. 

I was told that my sandwich I previously had, El Cubanito was more of a vegetarian option. He wanted to give me an experience with the other food options - elote with Hot Cheetos, chicken empanadas, Media Noche, and Ropa Vieja. I was also able to try their Cafe Con Leche and Hibiscus  Lemonade. 

To start off, the drinks are delicious. The Cafe Con Leche isn't too sweet but isn't too bitter. Definitely a must try! The Hibiscus Lemonade is bitter and sweet. The combination is amazing. Who knew bitter and sweet works so well together. If you're not someone who likes sweet drinks, definitely try this out! 

And now to the food. We started off with the elote with hot Cheetos then chicken empanadas. The elote - such an amazing twist. The butter and mayo on the corn, slapped on with some hot Cheetos crumbs. It's an experience you should try! & the chicken empanadas, super crispy. Inside is so moist with the chicken with cheese. The sauce it comes with on the side is sweet and refreshing. I want more! 
Now to the sandwich and burrito. The moment I bit into the Media Noche, I was hit with the sweet guava jelly then the savory grilled turkey, cheese and egg. The bread, toasted and crunchy. I love it. And the crunchiness from the pickles. It all comes together. So many unique flavors and textures. It's amazing. 
And my all time favorite is the Ropa Vieja. It's a burrito with so much flavor and stuffing packed in. From the juicy slow cooked beef. Super chewy and flavorful. The rice, not too hard and not too soft. Also the cheese and egg just melts in your mouth. Not many textures but definitely so many flavors. The flavor from the slow cooked beef and the egg and cheese just works together. I am a fan!! 

I'm so grateful for Juan - reaching out to me and allowing me to experience his family's restaurant. I am definitely glad I came back and tried the other options on their menu. I will definitely come back! Great service and amazing food! Best family restaurant ever!"
ninis-deli-chicago,Allison J.,"Yelp used to have an option to order from Nini's Deli online & pick-up in the store. Well, I ordered a sandwich online & showed up to quickly be informed that Nini's Deli actually did not take orders from Yelp... What could have been a frustrating/disappointing experience was quickly turned around by the amazing staff at Nini's Deli. Not only did they rush my order so I was still able to walk out right away with my meal, but they threw in a free lemonade & avocado for my sandwich!

The ability for them to go above and beyond on customer service really entices me to be a repeat customer! But it wasn't only the service that was noteworthy.. the FOOD was delicious too! I ordered a sandwich that was on special for the day that had eggs, steak, avocado, cheese and some other toppings. It was large, savory and delicious! 

Amazing sandwiches, affordable prices and INCREDIBLE service! 
What more can you ask for in a deli?!? 
I'll be back, Nini's!"
ninis-deli-chicago,Keelin B.,"This place is a true gem! I can't stop thinking about it. I was craving a ropa vieja sandwich and used Yelp to look for one near me. Luckily, Nini's is super close to my work. I saw all of the wonderful reviews and menu and knew I had to go. Nini's is located in an inconspicuous corner building. I wouldn't have found it had it not been for the people sitting outside. It was PACKED. Not uncomfortably packed but enough that there were very few seats and I knew it was going to take a bit. So I don't recommend going if you're in a hurry (or order ahead if you are). I waited in line to place a to-go order at the cash register. Plenty of time to take in the surroundings and the menu. Nini's has a fun and lively atmosphere. You can tell people are enjoying their food and looking forward to it. I ordered a media noche sandwich (turkey, an egg patty, cheese, pickles, etc.), a beautiful iced cafe con leche with whip cream and cinnamon, and the special: a goat cheese and guava empanada. The owner is as lively and pleasant as everyone has mentioned. It's amazing how he is able to make you feel really special ,as a customer and get your order in.

I got my order in and hung out for probably 10 minutes or less. I had to eat back at my office, but man was it good. Everything was perfectly cooked and flavorful. The media noche was HUGE. I ended up eating only half that day and half the next (I toasted it and it reheated great!). 

I will be returning...hopefully to eat in the restraunt."
ninis-deli-chicago,Michael S.,"Fantastic neighborhood spot. Terrific sandwiches, burrito, and cafe con leche. Juan is extremely friendly and welcoming. Will definitely be back on a regular basis."
two-chicago,Linda B.,"I loved it.  TWO has been on my list for several years and I used restaurant week as my opportunity to try it out.

I asked the server for a glass of pinot noir to start and was surprised by how smooth it was!  Such a great way to start things off.

I am not the hugest fan of Brussel sprouts, but the ones at TWO are among the best I've ever had.  They were cooked and seasoned perfectly.  I'm told the bisque was tasty as well.

I also had the spaghetti which was a more interesting dish than you might think (bacon always helps).  For our main entrees, I had the wagyu brisket and my friend had the pork tenderloin: both were good, I probably preferred the pork even though it was a touch too salty.

The nutella panna cotta was wonderful, it was light, smooth, and delicious.  Service was average, not as good as what I expected, but not bad.  But the food was amazing and that's the most important part."
two-chicago,TD T.,"Restaurant week menus are sometimes a hit or a miss - TWO's selection was definitely a hit for us!! Service was very attentive and friendly. 

The dining area has 2 separate sections, one with individual tables and one with the bar and a communal seating space, which is pretty unique. Has sort of that modern rustic feel.  

We enjoyed all 4 courses and were impressed with the value and quality. Bisque was a nice creamy starter, the prawns were large, the spaghetti had this unique white sauce that was delish, and the brisket was so tender and juicy in the stew/broth. The panna cotta was very tasty to finish the meal. They also have a cocktail and beer selection. I forgot which cocktail I had but it was the right balance of alcohol. 

Will come back to try other menu items!"
two-chicago,Nazish C.,"Pretty good food! This place is worth checking out for the duck fat potato croquettes alone. They are so delicious! My fianc√© got the burger and fries. The meat on the burger was well cooked and well seasoned. I got the crab pasta. It was a pasta dish with crab soup topped wit Thai chili and peanuts. It was interesting, but a little weird. We finished the night with the honey cheesecake which was quite delicious. 

Overall, this place has pretty good food and excellent service. Worth checking out if you're in the area."
two-chicago,Julie Y.,"TWO was the BEST surprise of Restaurant Week. I can already say that I will be back again and would recommend to friends in a heart beat. 

I love what it's about - sourcing locally with an ever changing menu. The food is innovative and unique without being pretentious. I love that I can come here in jeans and feel at home while dining on spectacular food at extremely reasonable prices. 

Restaurant week was a phenomenal value. $33 for four courses!!

I chose;
CRAB BISQUE - unabashedly briny with rich crab flavor. the portion size was small but was perfect for how rich it was. the chili oil added just a hint of heat 
GULF PRAWNS - three large prawns with creamy grits. the sauce was peppery and a great balance for the richness of the grits. 
SPAGHETTI WITH MUSHROOMS - I tasted my friend's homemade spaghetti and it was amazing as well. the mushroom almost smacks you in the face with flavor (but in a good way). the spaghetti was also handmade and perfectly cooked. 
WAGYU BRISKET - I love brisket and this brisket was beautifully tender. the sunflower pesto was super unique and added just the right amount of crunch!
NUTELLA S'MORES - I could have eaten five of these. I was so full but I could have eaten so many of these. I would come back just for this alone. 

Overall, yes yes yes!! I can't wait to come back and try their new innovative dishes next year for RW 2019 and for many weeks in between."
two-chicago,Katie C.,"I visited Two Chicago this week for their Chicago Restaurant Week Menu. I made my reservations through Open Table for my friend and I. We arrived at the restaurant a couple minutes after our 7p reservation. 

There are two spaces to the restaurant - the front bar area with communal tables and the main dining area. We walked in and were slightly confused but saw the host stand and approached it. 

From the time we walked into the restaurant to the time we reached the host stand no one greeted us. As we stood at the host stand, a few servers looked in our direction and/or walked by but still no one greeted us. 

Then finally, we were acknowledged by the host (who may have actually been the manager), but he could not find our reservation at first. I don't know if this was due to the restaurant or open table. Even though our reservation was found, there were no tables available. We were told it would just be a few moments as some tables were paying their bills. 

In the meantime, we stood near the host stand with our coats and just felt like we were in the way. It was actually quite awkward. I wish the host or manager would have handled the situation better. He could've asked if we wanted to sit at the bar or offered to take our coats while we waited.... really anything. 

We were finally seated around 7:20p and ordered from the CRW menu. Items came relatively quickly. For the most part, portions were small but food was tasty. Some items were better than others but overall I enjoyed everything. While we were enjoying the food, I was a bit disappointed that our server never checked in asking how we were doing or if we needed anything. 

We tried almost everything on the CRW Menu, which I posted below, except for the Pork Tenderloin. The shrimp and crab bisque was good but it was such a tiny portion. We also enjoyed the brussel sprouts. Though not the best I've had, I liked the addition of the chorizo and feta. The prawns were quite tasty but the spaghetti dish stole the show. This was definitely one of the best dishes on the restaurant menu. It was packed full of flavor and so delicious that I am actually going to try to recreate it at home this weekend. The brisket was also quite good - it was so tender and juicy and bursting with flavor. 

I appreciated that most of the menu is gluten free and they also offer vegetarian options though I found out that another friend of mine was dining at Two the same night as me. She is vegetarian and they offered her the same dishes minus the meat... not really sure how they could present the 3rd course as an option though.

Two is one of the few places that offers a bonus 4th course - dessert - which was a Nutella s'mores pannacotta. My friend and I were pleasantly surprised by this dish. It was light and sweet but not too sweet and just very enjoyable. With that being said, I also found out that someone else I know dined at Two the following night for the CRW menu and the Nutella pannacotta was served completely different from the night before - not sure why. I believe consitency is key to qulaity.

Two definitely offers one of the best restaurant week deals with 4-courses at only $33. The deal was great and the food was delicious but service was definitely lacking.

When I patronize an establishment, I expect to feel welcome and treated well. Unfortunately, I felt like more of a bother than a guest from not being greeted to being made to feel awkward while we waited past our reservation for a table, and then feeling rushed as we ate our meal. 

It wasn't the worst experience but it definitely wasn't the best. Knowing that other friends of mine experienced similar poor service is a red flag to me. Two may serve incredible food but their service needs to improve. 

Based off my one experience I am hesitant to go back though at the same time I won't rule it out as I believe everyone deserves a second chance.

two-chicago,Marq C.,"5 stars for excellent service, toothsome  food, great value, location, and warm ambiance. This restaurant is close to the highway and close to the city without having to deal with the insane city parking rates. 
I came here because of a Groupon deal. For $80, you get a bottle of wine and a chef's selection five course meal. Amazing deal!
Arugula salad- fresh, crispy, and had a balanced sweet and salty taste with the addition of the apples and shaved cheeses. 
Trout- this fish is cooked in its skin to secure the flavor and create a soft and crunchy texture to the fish. EXCELLENT dish. It was so flavorful with the addition of the caviar that add another layer of texture and taste. Magnifique!
Half chicken- sounds boring but it's not! The meat was so tender, juicy, and infused with flavor. There was so much flavor and extraordinary tenderness you would think you're eating duck. It's chicken, No worries! 
Pasta cavatelli- another chef's creation that is surprisingly and wildly tasty! The mixture of the pasta and pumpkin with the chorizo plays a mini festival in your mouth. There's a lot of flavors competing and they're all winners! Great dish if you're looking for a non mundane pasta dish. 
'Smores- this is an upscale jello pudding made out of Nutella with crushed graham and a super fancy roasted marshmallow. Pretty and decadent. 

TIP: on Thursdays, they have half price burgers."
two-chicago,Ara H.,"Was there for a celebratory dinner during Restaurant Week. We got three RW menus and a side of the bread/butter/eggplant appetizer.

The initial courses were all very delicious - they were seafood bisque, Brussel sprouts, prawns (though the salsa verde on top wasn't so good), pasta. The main meat courses on the other hand were less good - the brisket was too salty and the pork was too heavy. We didn't finish those.

The dessert - the Nutella chocolate marshmallow thingamajig was not good at all - we left almost all of it untouched.

Finally, we also had cocktails which were excellent.

Overall a decent experience. Would be interested to try the non RW menu."
two-chicago,Soyoung S.,"Came here for my boyfriends birthday dinner and was pleasantly satisfied. We had an intimate party of 3 with him and his brother who was visiting from nyc. 

We ordered 7 dishes and left feeling quite full. But when I got home, I did feel a little sick. Not because the food wasn't fresh, but because it was verrrry heavy. A lot of duck fat that night lol

We ordered the croquettes fried in duck fat, a salad, scallops, roasted half chicken, cheeseburger, special of the night which was roasted lamb ribs, duck egg fettuccine, and another half chicken because it was so good.

My favorites of the night was the half chicken and the salad. I'm not a salad gal, but this arugula salad was so delicious I almost ordered a second. 

The roasted half chicken was hands down the best chicken I have ever had in my entire life. I didn't even know chicken could taste like that. What ""chicken"" have I been eating all my life before this? 

The scallops were not great though, they didn't have any flavor to them. But that's ok because all of the other dishes were great.

I was really disappointed that our server didn't do anything special for my boyfriends birthday, even though I made sure to note it on my opentable reservation :(

But that's okay. We still want to come back once the menu changes, the quality of the food and the skills of the chefs are insane. Can't believe this place isn't packed to the brim every night!"
two-chicago,Lily Z.,"I brought the boy here for his birthday dinner.

When I arrived, I didn't know the host stand is located in between the bar area and the dining room. So I stood by the front door, waited for someone to direct me, asked the bartender who didn't respond, walked to the host table which was empty, watched waiters and bussers walk past me until someone came. 

We ordered the croquettes (nice kick in the sauce), pate (eh), crab spaghetti and the fish (disappointing). We were told that they serve tapas style but we couldn't course out the meal (more entree-like dishes towards the end) and would receive food whenever it was ready. While we were dining, a group of friends sat at the table right next to us. While we were eating our meal, I noticed one person was missing his entree while everyone else was devouring their food. After about 30-40 minutes of waiting and about to ask for the check, he asked about his food and the waitress (our same waitress) told him they don't serve food while there's still food on the table. Are you serious? After a waiting for a total of an hour, he finally got his roasted chicken.

I would not come out of my way to eat here but I guess if you're in the area? Seems to be a neighborhood spot."
two-chicago,Mallory B.,"Came in for restaurant week and had a great meal!! Our party was seated immediately at our reservation time, our water glasses were always full, and our waiter did not pressure us into getting stuff that's not on the restaurant week menu aggressively, as I have seen happen some places.

They had 2 cocktail specials for RW, an old fashioned and a lemony pineau de charentes drink. Both were amazing and a steal at $9.

I tried the brussel sprouts 1st course, which was delicious. The bisque option is also a great choice (stole a bite from a pal). The prawns and grits was maybe my favorite course, the green sauce and creamy grits went together so well with the prawns! I had the roast pig over the wagyu, which came with sweet potatoes. I thought it was a little salty, but would eat it again. FINALLY THE NUTELLA DESERT JUST WOW. Elevated s'mores are IT"
two-chicago,Laura Y.,"Okay, so where do I begin with Two.  Firstly, the staff here are so friendly and I love the atmosphere that this place gives off-- it's classy but not snobby. This place is definitely, 100% worth if you buy the Groupon which pretty much gives you a 5 course chef's tasting menu + a bottle of wine (the bottle of wine totaled up to be $50 so that itself is worth) for about ~$89. Overall, for one of the best tasting menus I've ever had in my entire life, for about ~$55 per person (including tip and tax and with the groupon) it's so worth it, and I would go again and again.  Especially since TWO is a Michelin Bib Gourmand (although to be honest, it deserves to be Michelin seeing how I feel like TWO really got down the right quantity and quality of food and honestly might be better than some other places I've been to).

Heirloom Tomato Salad (4.5/5)-- $14-- I've honestly never had such good tasting tomatoes before.  I'm not sure how they made it, but even though the dish may first look skimpy, the taste of it is amazing.  The bacon is (they told us) house made, and I thought personally it was a bit too salty for my liking and a little bit too hard, but the tomatoes 100% made up for it.

Alaskan Halibut (5/5)--$20-- TWO continued to impress with this dish.  The fish was so tender on the inside but crunchy on the outside, and overall, mixed with the sweet creamy corn that was on the bottom of the dish, this easily was one of my favorite dishes of the night. Please get this dish-- 100% worth it, you won't regret it.  The fish is so fresh and tender and they make it perfectly.

Duck Egg Fettuccine (5/5)--$16-- This was the thing that caught my eye on the menu when I first saw this restaurant, and I'm so glad this was part of the tasting menu. I love, love, love duck and the way they made this dish was so delicious I wanted more. The fettuccine was one of the best I've had and they made the duck perfectly.

Slagel Farms Pork Tenderloin (3.5/5)--$20-- This dish was where TWO fell a little flat-- the dish was a little bit too spicy for me but even besides that, although the meat was very tender and cooked well, it wasn't anything too special.  I feel like thus far, all the other dishes have seemed unique and special in some sense and this was just some well-cooked tenderloins that were a bit spicy. 

Honey Cheesecake (4/5)--$7-- Again, same as above, this cheesecake was nothing too special but still good to eat and delicious. I wish they added more fruit to top the cheesecake

Overall, the meal was supposed to be around ~127 before tax and tip and we paid $89 for it so worth!!!  Definitely, give TWO a try.  It doesn't disappoint."
two-chicago,Emily H.,"3.5 stars rounded up to 4 because the staff was nice

Pros: friendly and attentive servers, nice ambiance
Cons: long wait between dishes, hit-or-miss dishes

My boyfriend and I went here tonight for Restaurant Week ($33 for 4 courses). Our reservation was at 6:30pm, and after checking in with the host we found out they were running a little late and that it would be approximately an extra 7-10 minutes wait. Unfortunately, we weren't seated until like 7pm. I was annoyed with this extra wait, but the host's stellar customer service helped make up for it. He checked in with us during our wait and thanked us for being patient. He explained they were running behind due to the earlier dinner crowd arriving late, so I understand that this was an unfortunate circumstance that was out of the restaurant's control. 

I ordered the shrimp and crab bisque, spaghetti, and wagyu brisket, while my boyfriend got the gulf prawns and pork tenderloin for his second and third course. 
Good: The gulf prawns were flavorful albeit smaller portions. Wagyu brisket was juicy and savory. The bonus course, nutella panna cotta, was yummy and a nice way to finish the meal.
Okay: The shrimp and crab bisque was good but lacked the extra oomph to be great. 
Bad: The spaghetti was barely flavored. Pork tenderloin was kind of dry and portions were tiny. 

The servers were nice and attentive, but our food came out really slow. We waited about 10-15 minutes between each course (except for dessert which came out really quick). I don't know if this is how it usually is or if it's just the kinks due to the start of restaurant week, but dinner felt like it dragged on for longer than it needed to be. 

Overall, I had an okay time, and I can see that so many people love this place so I wish I had a similar experience. Unfortunately, the wait times and the slightly disappointing food are just too much for me to want to come back when there are so many other restaurants to try in Chicago."
two-chicago,Helen C.,"I'd like to give them four stars based on food but in good conscience I cannot due to the horrible service here.

Came here for the restaurant week menu with 3 other friends and we were ready to drink, eat and catch up. 

We were greeted by a guy who didn't say much or make any eye contact and just sat us in the corner and left the menus on the table. I understand it's restaurant week but a warm greeting never hurts.

Our server seemed rushed to take our order and half of the time he did not bring us new set of utensils after the old ones were taken away.At the end of our meal, he told us we have to leave since the next reservation was waiting.

It's really unfortunate since the food was really good and well executed. The meat course was slightly on the salty side but I didn't mind it that much. However the quality of the food was totally overshadowed by the poor service and indifference it was very off putting.  I think it's important for restaurant to create a memorable experience with not only their food but also with service. TWO will be memorable for me but definitely not in a good way."
two-chicago,Julie S.,"My husband and I went to TWO for our anniversary. Our reservation was for 6:30 pm and there was only 1 other table in the restaurant at the time. By the time we left at 8, the place was almost full!

Upon being seated, we received free champagne which was unbelievably thoughtful. We ordered:

-Duck fat potato croquettes with a chili aioli. Very good, large quantity, definitely recommend.

-Bacon jam and toast. This was not so much jam as a pork pate. Slightly odd, but tasty. 

-Tri-tip steak. It was prepared well with seasonal zucchini two ways. Definitely something I would order again.

-Duck egg fettuccini. Very rich. The dish doesn't have a duck egg on top, the pasta is made with duck eggs. It then has duck meat, and duck cracklins.

They had a peach pie on the menu but we were too full to try it.

Overall I would return!"
two-chicago,Marc B.,"Overall very good experience start to finish. Started out in bar for a couple unique and tasty cocktails. We were then treated like royalty by host and were seated at a perfect table. Started with the duck fat potato croquettes which would be very well suited for a hungover Sunday bar snack. They were good, not great. Next was a salad. Entrees of scallops and duck egg fettuccine. The fettuccine was by far my favorite dish. Absolutely delicious. Fresh house made pasta is the key. The scallops were as good as any high end seafood restaurant I've dined in. For dessert we had the Smores, Nutella panna cotta and cheesecake. The cheesecake was forgettable and the panna cotta was very good. Overall I would definitely recommend Two. Very solid food with great service. Very good price point for the entire experience."
two-chicago,Daniel C.,Dined during restaurant week and did the prix fixe menu.  Highly recommend and great value.  Unique cocktail menu.  Excellent service.  Favorite dish was the wagyu beef.
two-chicago,Colleen B.,"My family and I had a wonderful dining experience at Two recently. My sister lives in the area and had walked by it multiple times and has been wanting to visit. The restarting is very open with a lot of beautiful woodwork. It is quite inviting and cozy! We started out with a cocktail at the bar. They have an extensive cocktail list which were all freshly made and tasty. The bartender was quite knowledgeable and friendly! We did choose a few bottles of wine for our dinner and they were great. Two has a very extensive wine list, as well!

We came here with a party of 6 and chose the chef's tasting menu. It was about 35 dollars per person (which was a great deal). I honestly cannot say one negative comment about the dishes we were served. Everything was perfectly prepared and had such great flavor. The halibut dish and Nutella smores were my personal favorite. The service was also exceptional!

Overall, I highly recommend Two. It is officially one of my new favorite restaurants. Thank you for a wonderful dining experience!"
two-chicago,Zip T.,"Most of the staff was amazing, ambiance is great,  late reservations available. 
Went for restaurant week menu @ 4 courses for 33$. I do love this week because it opens us up to restaurants we haven't tried or known about before. The soup was amazing,  flavorful. The spaghetti was different and good. The waygu brisket and pig were okay. I would give this place 3.5 stars. I'm not a snob but I didn't feel a good connection with our waitress which made the night kind of awkward. Not everyone likes to drink with their dinners. She seemed upset and surprised when we did not want to order drinks.  Asked us a second time about the drinks then topped it off sarcastically a 3rd time if we finally would want a round of shots when desserts came out. It felt really pushy and awkward. Trust me if we want something, we would let you know. It was really awkward but the rest of the staff was great."
two-chicago,John H.,"Been here twice, absolutely blown away both times!

First time it was just 2 of us and we ordered a la carte.  The venison entree was mouth watering and left us remarking about it for days.

Second time we had a group of 6 (the minimum) and ordered the chef's tasting option.  It was less than $50 a person, and was almost too much food for us to eat.  That wasn't an issue though as everything was rave worthy.  They brought 2 plates of each course to the table to share.  I think it was 2 veggie plates, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts.  The most memorable was the crusted halibut and the raspberry cheesecake.

They do a great job of making you feel welcome and at home here.  A plethora of tasty cocktail and wine options as well.

My favorite tapas in Chicago so far."
two-chicago,Dan G.,"My girlfriend and I bought a Groupon ($92) and came here yesterday for Sunday dinner. We live a few blocks away and have been always wanting to check this place out especially since the restaurant has been in the running to receive a Michelin star. As we got seated I was excited to look through the wine list since the groupon states we can choose a bottle ""up to $70 value"" well when the waitress came up to us she asked if we wanted red or white. I was a little puzzled and said red. Then she asked Cabernet or pinot noir. I asked well can I see some of the different options and she said sorry we already have a bottle specifically picked out that goes with the groupon deal. I wasn't thrilled about that, a moment later she brings us out a bottle of Deloach Pinot Nior. That felt like a slap in the face because that is a $9.99 bottle of wine at a store. I'm not quite sure how a restaurant that is aiming for a Michelin Star can serve such low grade wine. I was highly disappointed with this so minus 1 star. 

I've deducted a second star due to the portions of the meals along with the nonexistent choice that we had similar to the wine. Again on the groupon it says it has to be up to a certain dollar amount. For my understanding that means I pick what I want that falls in that criteria. This wasn't the case. Each item we received was already arranged and we had no choice besides dietary restrictions which we didn't have. Let's get to the portions. First salad tasted great but there was 1 small piece of bacon on it.... 2 people 1 piece of bacon. Yeppp doesn't add up. Next came the fish. It was delicious but again not enough for 2 people. After that was the meat dish which was a steak. (Shoulder cut) seemed to be about 4oz cut into 4 small pieces. Meat was a bit rough for my taste, they should have gone with a filet mignon. Next was pasta biggest portion out of everything (figures because it's the cheapest) tasted great. And last the dessert. Tasted nice too. 

Was all of this worth the $92 that I paid not in a million years. My recommendation to the restaurant is to hire a sommelier and reconstruct the portions for the proper amount of people. I would like to come back again and hopefully have a better experience because I can see a lot of potential for Two."
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Michael V.,"Had a fantastic dinner here with a group of 12 this past Saturday. When I first called to make the reservation they were having a maintenance issue and weren't sure if they'd be open. The manager was super nice and took my name & number and called me back later to let me know everything was fixed and they could accommodate our group. 

The restaurant is just one long stretch of tables against the windows, nice and cozy without feeling crowded. Our server was really friendly and definitely went the extra mile to take care of our group. They had an unexpectedly awesome beer list too, with bottles from Off Color, Moody Tongue and Temperance.  

Pizzas are rather large, so 2 people per pie is a good estimate. We ordered a bunch of different ones and I have to say everything was phenomenal!! The sausage/pepper special, the meatball with ricotta and the prosciutto with greens stood out. You really can't go wrong!

Can't say enough good things about Pizzeria Bebu. Can't wait to go back!"
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Al D.,"Average to sub-par pizza. 

Crust is inedible. 

Some toppings weren't great, like the (burnt) bacon. 

Terribly salty, too. The only enjoyable pizza is the mushroom special. 

If you're a dweller in a nearby condo, then you might appreciate Bebu for its proximity. Otherwise, it's not worth a drive."
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Rachel Z.,"We ordered delivery from Pizzeria Bebu through Caviar. The delivery experience was quick and easy but I can tell the pizza would be much better when dining in- it wasn't hot when it arrived.

They have many different specialty pizzas and they'll let you order half and half. We got the Ode to Rubirosa which was delicious. For the other half, we got the clam pizza which as an east-coast transplant I really appreciated but my boyfriend found too salty. Probably only good to order if you know you like clam pizza. 1 pizza was more than enough food for 2 people.

Would love to come back and dine it to try more!"
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Shoshanna C.,"I take improv classes at the neighboring IO theater which is honestly the only reason we stopped into this place. Every time I walk by, it smells amazing! Honestly, it's pretty easy to miss as the place kinda looks like a random store front or something.

First, the positives: the pizza that I ordered was AMAZING. When you sit down they give you a build your own pizza menu and then a list of their specials. I chose ""The Happy Accident"", an amazing mixture of arugula (always great), caramelized and raw onions, honey, and an egg. (I don't eat meat, so they were able to make the pizza without prosciutto) 

I have to say, this pizza was truly amazing. As someone who often has their orders modified, the flavor of the pizza didn't suffer at all from a lack of meat. It was perfect!

Now for the negatives: With all of that being said, no one else was too thrilled with their choices. My boyfriend ordered the spicy clam pizza and liked it but didn't love it, he thinks it would have better if he got the clam pizza with the white sauce. My mom got the potato and rosemary pizza which she said was okay but again not amazing. 

Furthermore, the service was pretty slow. It probably took us 30-40 minutes to get our pizza. There was no warning that it might take forever to get your food, which sometimes is the case with pizza, they kinda just ignored is for 30-40 minutes while we waited for our food. On top of that, the music was way too loud. And I don't mean in a trendy hip restaurant way, it was so loud that I couldn't hear the person next to me. 

All in all, I would definitely go back but I think I might take a pizza to go rather than sit for 40 minutes and wait."
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,C.C. H.,"Great addition to the Neapolitan pizza places around town, up there in crust and ingredient quality with Spacca Napoli and Paulie Gee's. Lots of great topping varieties and they will let you do half and half. The Little Gem salad was also very fresh and flavorful - a great starter option."
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Colin X.,"We ordered a Sausage & Broccoli Rabe/Bebu Meatball half-and-half pizza, and it was brought to our table about 10 minutes after we had ordered it (possibly faster than usual since we were the only people in the restaurant at the time). On the topic of ordering, our server must've been psychic or something because he came to us the exact moment that we had decided what we wanted from the menu. He was also extremely attentive and frequently checked-in with us to see if everything was OK.

As for the pizza, simply put, it was very good-- a very nice change of pace from the usual Chicago deep dish pizza. We were talking to our server and he mentioned how their pizza oven is the same as the ovens used in the famous thin crust pizzerias of NYC which is something that I can totally believe because the crust came out deliciously crispy at the back of the pizza ""hand holding area"" and very firm on the underside of the pizza to support all of the ingredients on top. I loved the addition of the giardiniera in the Bebu Meatball pizza--it gave the pizza an interesting crunch that I've never experienced from a pizza before. The sausage on the Sausage & Broccoli Rabe pizza was pretty ordinary, but the broccoli rabe gave every bite a unique vegetabley taste (which made me feel better with my decision to eat pizza since now I was also eating vegetables!)."
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Shari B.,"We came here for an early dinner and the restaurant was pretty empty, except for one other couple. It's located further away from North Ave in a less crowded area. We opted to sit outside to enjoy the nice weather while we still can. They have a many options on their menu, especially since they have an entire secret pizza menu that's not listed online. And they also let you choose half and half pizzas without extra charge.

We had the blistered shishito peppers to start and got a pizza with half funghi and half sausage & piparras. The portion size of the shishito peppers was very large, but I felt like they were a little over-cooked. Their pizza has neopolitan-style crust with modern American toppings (generous sauce, cheese, toppings). I enjoyed both pizzas equally and the crust was light and chewy.

I would skip the shishito peppers next time. They've got lots of yummy sounding pizza combos, so I wouldn't mind stopping by again when we are in the area."
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Emily D.,"Was really excited to try this place after seeing its stellar reviews but thought it was just ok. 

Started with the Brussel sprouts salad. It was good and I really enjoyed the dressing but overall, not very exciting. 

Got the margherita pizza and really did not like the crust (which they are very proud of). To me, it was an odd combo of crunchy and airy. Aside from my dislike of the crust, however, I could tell the ingredients were really high quality. But it was hard to enjoy a pizza with a crust I didn't enjoy. 

In addition, the service was fast and extremely friendly! 

Overall, I would be willing to give it one more try, but it's not a place I would go back to soon."
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Alex S.,"Huzzah pizza!

Came here with a group of yelpers for a nice evening. They warned us that it might be busy for a group of people but we sat with no issue.

The menu is small but strong. Basically different delicious takes on pizzas with a few things like salads and sides. The pizzas all are thin crust NY style and have your normal margherita pizza to things like Carbonara pizza. That's neat.

The service here is totally on top. We were well looked after and when they brought us the wrong pie, they let us keep the first one and made a new one. 

They were also really reasonably priced. It was about $16 to $18 for a gourmet pizza that serves two (or three if you're not that hungry). 

Few little things that were weird, like they don't have pizza cutters or little pizza servers. Also the pizza was a tad bit greasy. Still delicious though.

I'd come back for a slice in a heartbeart. Bebu!"
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Christian M.,"I'm a 5 minute walk from this place... why did it take me over 3 months to finally come here?

I came here with 2 friends around 9pm on a Friday.  We were seated immediately although many tables were taken.

The interior was dim, and a little tight, BUT it was really gorgeous in a contemporary or maybe modern way.  You feel that you are in a very high quality restaurant due to the interior design and decor.

We ordered the prosciutto pizza which has panna, roasted garlic, prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, arugula, and red onion.  

This place seems to specialize in neapolitan/neapolitan-like pizza and our proscuitto pizza was extremely good.  Considering all the ingredients on top, you've think this would be too moist and mushy, but moisture was under control and the crust was great.  This pizza had a lot of flavor and it only took like 15 minutes total for it to come out, if I recall correctly.

Service was also great as well!

Pizzas, on average, were like $15 or so, so it's actually not too pricey; I truly believe the quality is there.

This place is a strong go-to for neapolitan/neapolitan-like pizza and I'm sure I'll be back when my cravings for such a style of pizza comes back.  I'd strongly consider bringing a date here since the interior can be intimate."
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Carrie M.,"Love that you can do half and half flavors on a pizza. We tried the meatball and the potato pizzas. Both were excellent, with a light and crispy crust. Top notch service, with great advice in wine. Will definitely be back."
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Jazz S.,"One pizza should be enough for about 2 people, but we got two pizzas because we wanted to try as many toppings as possible. One nice thing is that you can split each pizza into two completely different styles (highly recommend doing this). From the 4 types we got, I'd recommend the FUNGHI for any person who loves mushrooms (I do and it was great). The other 3 were specials and they were all creative with unique toppings that worked well together. One of them had breadcrumbs (I think?) and I absolutely loved that texture. The prices are about ~$20/pizza which I think is worth it for how filling they are.

This place gets 5 stars not because the pizza is mindblowingly good (although it is pretty good), but just because from the moment you step in it  feels like a very classy and comfortable establishment. The bathrooms are super clean, our server (who was the owner I believe) was extremely hospitable and made us feel special. The carry out boxes and bags were great quality. We did come during an off-hours time on a weekday and there were not many other people so that may have helped.

I'd definitely come back and recommend others to go as well."
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Veronica C.,"This has become my number one pizza place in Chicago. You can't go wrong with the carbonera pizza, soppresatta, meatballs, just everything really. The crust is the perfect mix of crunchy, chewy and airy. Enjoy!"
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Tatiana M.,"2 stars for service. 1 star for the ricotta.

Based on all of these reviews, I think I had my expectations set at some absurd level because I walked out feeling neutral. It wasn't bad by any means, but it didn't blow me away either. I do believe it was overpriced by a few dollars, but what can you do.

They let you mix/match your pizza halves with any of the pizzas on the menu which was nice if everyone wants something different. We got 4 pizzas off the menu. We got one pizza from the giardiniera special. A full pistachio pizza. Half a pizza with meatball/ricotta and half with funghi. 

I liked the meatball and the ricotta, the highlight of alllllll the pizzas. They were like clouds, perched on the pizza, guiding your mouth to heaven. Amazing! But unfortunately, the ricotta was the only highlight of our pizza selections. We all left feeling underwhelmed."
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Gus L.,"Try. The. Clam. Pizza. Now.

Our company ordered some pies from here when they opened and they were fantastic. I have ordered and picked up before and it was fantastic too. Finally took the opportunity to eat-in today with a colleague and I can say with certainty, it's one of the best pizzas in the city. Not too thin, not thick, airy crispy crust and the toppings are all fresh and tasty. We had the clam pizza and probably could have eaten a second one if it appeared. The service was quick and friendly. I hope this place does well despite that this area still isn't really developed as a pedestrian-friendly few blocks but that may change once more people move into the building above them. Anyways, check this place out, they seem to have a nicely crafted wine program, however I haven't been able to try and I'm not much of a wine person anyways."
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Erik Y.,"This could become my go-to spot for some pie! The place is fairly small and has a great vibe. The salads are great to share as a starter (feeds 3 at least.) For pizza, we shared a half and half: bagel smuggler and the spicy soppraseta pizza. I have two smallish issues: the bacon on the smuggler was delicious but should be chopped a little. The long slabs led them to sliding off easily. On the spicy soppraseta side, it was VERY greasy. Like, a pool of it. You can kind of tell in the photo but it was just a hot mess that made the pizza soggy.

I love this place and plan on returning a bunch this summer :)"
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Anthony M.,"Good service 
Clean restaurant
Vodka sauce and parmigiano were great
Salad was good 

I'll go back"
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Henriette K.,"Fabulous food, fabulous service, fabulous experience.
Came here on a rainy Saturday afternoon and ordered half mushroom/ half asparagus pizza. Both were incredibly tasty, and we are more then we should have, but it was just so good.
We also had cannoli, with pistachio and chocolate powder on the side, and I kept dipping my cannoli in it, that's how great it tasted.
The service was superb as well, and the owner came by multiple times to check in and make sure everything was to our liking.
Can't wait to come back!"
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Connie D.,I ordered the Tarte Flambebu pizza and chopped salad. Loved both. The salad dressing that came with the salad was fresh and delish.
pizzeria-bebu-chicago,Roshni S.,"The pizzeria is cozy and small and perfect for a quick snack or an intimate gathering of few friends. The ambiance is extremely casual and laid back which makes trying all of the pizza a perfect proposition. We ordered the the 50/50-half fungi and half the hot daisy. The fungi was delicious and crisp, but the the hot daisy was too spicy to enjoy. At first, the back taste of a tabasco kick isn't off putting, but a few bites in and my mouth was on fire! While i didn't love this suggestion, there are quite a few options (that you can convert to be veggie friendly) that i want to try. The menu is simple and approachable. We followed up with the cannoli for dessert which was delicious! Id be back in the summer to enjoy the patio after some shopping. Also the service was incredibly accommodating and friendly!"
ada-street-chicago,Dan G.,"Great food, great drinks, great atmosphere, excellent service!!!

One of my friends told me about Ada St and finally decided to give it a try yesterday! The place itself is well hidden, now I know why! Once you enter the place you can start to hear the music, the darkness, the candles and the tall wooden ceilings make the place feel cozy/hip/speakeasy.

Once we went in the manager greeted us right away and moved some tables since it was a big group. He went above and beyond to set up the table and make sure it wasn't wobbly. After we were seated our sever introduced herself and gave some recommendations! 

Everyone got a different drink and my favorite was Harvest on the moon, she was also very accommodating and was able to create a drink with mezcal, super refreshing!

We ordered almost every single item on the menu, they are small portions but worth trying them from the Singapore Chili Crab Cakes to the steak tartare to the grilled octopus, just amazing! And to end the night we got the Chocolate Ganache just a great.

Again, top notch service! 

Overall great experience and definitely going back!"
ada-street-chicago,Gregory C.,"LOVED!   The experience I had during restaurant week was glorious.  I would recommend this venue to anyone and everyone.   I've been several times over the past year.  However, for restaurant week - they really showed up and showed out!!!!

Fantastic service!"
ada-street-chicago,Cassandra A.,"I came for restaurant week 2018 and I was SO excited for the theme. I still love the theme but thought the meal left something to be desired. I wasn't very full. I had the broccoli, black rice, and chocolate dessert. Everything tasted VERY good but the portions were really small. I highly recommend a drink with their jalape√±o tequila.

I previously came in 2015 for a normal dinner and loved it so I will give this place 4 stars. Based only on restaurant week menu I would have given it 3.

Ambiance is nice, dark and chill. Feels like a speakeasy. Service is pretty good."
ada-street-chicago,Natasha S.,"Came here for the first time on a random Sunday night. What a great decision.  

Cocktails - mindblowing. Just do it. 

Hanger Steak - a little on the sweet side but good. 

Lamb Skewers - FYI these are fried. Also a little on the sweet side but fall off the bone. Must eat. 

Steak Tartare - so good. Rich but delicious. Extremely fresh and flavorful. Loved the presentation. 

Crispy Black Eyed Peas - yum! Such a great snack with a drink. 

Pretzel Bread Pudding - one of my new fav desserts. Made with pretzel bread! So warm and gooey."
ada-street-chicago,Racheal S.,"I happened to be at an event in this area, and stumbled upon Ada Street for late night eats and cocktails. The restaurant is very discreet, so look for Ada Street written on the metal door and walk right into this warm and inviting speakeasy. You walk down a hallway to the hostess, and can be seated in a smaller dining room or the larger dining room/bar area, which opens up to a quaint back patio. I loved the dark and cozy ambience, and my absolute favorite aspect of the restaurant was that they only spin vinyl music. Patrons of the restaurant can pick out music from the vinyl collection on one of the walls to be played. So awesome!

We sat at the bar and ordered the following cocktails: the Fucking French Martini (so yum!), Be Nice to Me (a sweeter prosecco cocktail), and Moon Glow (a dry gin drink). All of the cocktails were spot on and expertly crafted. Shout out to the bartender Chad, who was super knowledgeable and friendly. For small bites, we ordered the Pao de Quejo and Lamb Skewers. The food was very good, and we would definitely order the Pao de Quejo again (who doesn't love cheese bread??). After our small meal, we were given Amaro, compliments of the bar. Amaro is a delicious liqueur that you drink after your meal to aid with digestion. 

Overall, I was very impressed with the service and friendliness of the staff. We were checked in on by multiple staff members and made to feel very comfortable. Ada Street is definitely worth the visit, just for the ambience and experiences. But of course, stay for the delicious cocktails and vinyl. I am looking forward to returning!"
ada-street-chicago,Nicki P.,"After attending a wedding that was catered by Ada Street awhile back at marshalls landing, I couldn't shake the craving for the Gnocchi that stole my heart that day.  

Thankfully, to my surprise Ada Street is not far from my house at all, amazing and dangerous!   We stopped in on a Wed night around 8 and at first I was thrown by the small street and somewhat off the beaten path area, I was so pleasantly surprised when we walked in, when you first enter this labyrinth, we didn't know what to expect but the sweet jams playing over the sound system guided the way to the back where the main restaurant is.  On the path you pass smaller more intimate dining areas as well as several doors that are not very clearly marked (will get back to that later).  The candlelit romantic vibe was just what the hubs and I needed that night.  We started with a porter for him and a fucking french martini for me,  (that's what is was called and I made sure to order it with gusto :)

I am a bit of a sally when it comes to tasting my booze but I do love a good cocktail and this bad boy was amazing!  so refreshing and light but definitely packed a punch.  

 Servers were very attentive, it wasn't packed but they were on it regardless and very nice, great with suggestions as well.  

For mains we went with ( I had to go online and look up the names)

 - PAO DE QUEJO $10  - this is what god intended when he created mozzarella sticks, lol  these were little balls of lightly fried cheesy goodness with a spicy marinara sauce on the side, so tasty (5 pieces so you know we were both eyeing that last one, alas we split it!)

 - GOAT CHEESE DIP 12 - this was not your mama's goat cheese dip, it was light and decadent at the same time, the bacon jam wasn't overly sweet and the grilled crostini was perfect for dipping.

SINGAPORE CHILI CRAB CAKES 11 - these were the only misfire during our entire meal, after having pao de queso aka cheese ball amazingness, these crab cakes were dense and not very flavorful and the chili sauce was heavy when I was hoping for lighter, overall I would say skip these for sure. (I knew we should have went with the scallops:)

PARISIENNE GNOCCHI 13 - these little bites of goodness are just plain perfection, so soft yet had a nice sear on each one, they are so perfectly paired with brussel sprouts, kale, shallots and a light cheese.  I could eat these all day every day or at least until my pants don't fit anymore.  

PORK ADOBO 14 - the description mentioned sweet potato hay which I was curious about but that I never found in the dish..  what I did find was the most flavorful, juicy pork I have ever had, this dish was so good, my husband recommends adding a few of the gnocchi to the tortilla with the pork but I could eat that pork solo even sans tortilla all day.

And if you can believe it, we actually ordered dessert after all of that goodness!  we had the chocolate ganache with sea salt and for some reason I was thinking it would be more than just ganache but nope, it was just pure chocolatey decadence a nice scoop sprinkled with some sea salt and while this was great for the first few bites it is very rich so if you aren't into that sort of  thing maybe opt for one of the other desserts.  We liked it but may now have diabetes, just sayin'..

Thank you Ada Street we will most definitely be back and next time we're bringing everyone!"
ada-street-chicago,Christine K.,"I don't understand all the horrible reviews for RW. It was a pre set menu , and I got the broccoli, black rice and cereal bars. The portions were pretty small, but I didn't leave starving by any means . If anything, I thought the drinks were the overpriced part. The cereal bars were small, but VERY sweet. I loved the vibe but would like to try with their original menu in the summer ."
ada-street-chicago,Emily H.,"We came here for dinner on a Sunday and really enjoyed all the small bites on the menu. Especially loved the lamb and the scallop. The dessert here are pretty good too, loved the banana pudding.

The location is a bit weird, opposite a yard filled with huge recycle trucks and a bit hard to find."
ada-street-chicago,Rebeca M.,"HOLY YUM!!!! Where do I start!!? No seriously, I think we ordered EVERYTHING on the menu. 

Came in on Friday night with a group of friends. No reservations.. we did have to wait a while.. A LONG TIME. Like an hour, no biggie . Just a small restaurant with minimal room for waiting. 

My ONE issue was a server came over with our drinks and dropped my glass of red wine and it got ALL over me and my new satin jacket, she did apologize but that's it. I had to rush to the bathroom to try and clean myself up and didn't succeed .. ruined new jacket.

Now on to the food. Everything was great, we ordered tons of plates and just ate tapas style. The steak tartar, tuna tartar, and gnocchi where my absolute favorite, I wasn't a fan of the forbidden rice .. fairly bland and zero wow factor.

On  the dessert, yes. We ordered them all. Again, delicious. My favorite was the chocolate with toast. Sooooo good."
ada-street-chicago,Nadezda S.,"Loved this place ! We went with another couple , our best friends ! Drinks were amazing ! Food too ! Stuff was very friendly ! We simply enjoyed everything , the atmosphere is very cool , music is so great ! Such a fantastic night !"
ada-street-chicago,Kristin L.,"Reallyyyyyyy cool spot. I don't think hipster is the right word nor speakeasy. It has those feels but more upscale? Dim lighting, industrial feel (obviously the neighborhood), intimate spaces, private front room, very limited seating and small menu. 
Plates meant to be shared, very small portions but very delicious food. We tried the lamb skewers, forbidden black fried rice and gnocchi. All amazing could not go wrong. Oh and we also got the chocolate dessert: it was six pieces of toasted bread and a huge olive-oil, sea salt covered glob of chocolate that melted in your mouth. 
Even though my friend called ahead they didn't have a table for us but we had the choice of bar seating or seats watching the chefs cook. Went with bar seating, server was incredibly knowledge and friendly and fun."
ada-street-chicago,Aaron G.,"-Hidden entrance off an alley,
-Feels very swanky and speakeasy-like when you enter.
-You go down a long narrow candlelit hallway to get to the main dining room.
-The place was bustling, even on a Tuesday night.
-We had no reservation and had to wait a bit.  But the host was very nice and took our cocktail order while we waited.
-Black moon spell cocktail was delicious, the rye-based drink perfect for a cold winter's night.
-Glasses and presentation are amazing.
-Bottled ""50-ways to leave your lover"" drink was as interesting as the name--with rum and laphroig scotch--served in an old punch glass.
-Pao de queijo were phenomenal--couldn't have been better than if we were in Brazil.  They were warm, nice and crisp on the outside, and gooey and cheesy in the middle.
-Gnocchi were among the fluffiest I've ever had--so often gnocchi are so dense, but these were light, soft and perfect!
-Lamb skewers were properly cooked and served with a very tasty crispy rice side.
-Merguez meatball sliders were also very good--and came on these awesome challah-like rolls.
-I noticed that all the staff would pitch in for each other--which is rare and I really appreciated it!

It was a great dinner experience--we'll definitely be back soon!!"
ada-street-chicago,Anusha S.,"This restaurant is located in a quiet industrial neighborhood that almost looks deserted. Location plus the long quiet hallway leading you to the main bar and restaurant area sets a nice mysterious mood to your evening. 
The food was great! They serve small shareavle portions perfect for a date night. The ambience is cozy and cocktails delicious! Highly recommend this restaurant for a quiet evening."
ada-street-chicago,Adam M.,"Been here many times, so it's only fair I give Ada Street a review.

This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.

Atmosphere: 5/5 - could this place be any cooler?  It's intimate but airy, cool without trying too hard.  They nailed it.

Service:  5/5 - always kind, lighthearted, and most importantly, attentive.

Drinks: 5/5 - I had one of my favorite drinks of all time here.  Watermelon, Lime, jalapeno-infused tequila.  Incredible.

Food: 5/5 -  I'm never disappointed when I come here.  The food is always top notch, and Ada currently holds my title for best dessert of all time.  Pretzel Bread Pudding.  Literally changed my life - I almost cried as I ate it.  I know that sounds insane, but it's the only time that's happened to me.  So there's that.

Value: 4/5 - It's not inexpensive, but compared to trendier / more conveniently located restaurants, this place gives you a good bang for your buck.

This is one of my top recommendations for restaurants in this genre.  I've returned many times and will continue."
ada-street-chicago,Shambavi K.,"Thankfully, there was no wait for 3 people since we called ahead and arrived early around 6pm on a Sunday but we could still only get bar seats. 

Cocktails = 5+ stars. Amazingly well crafted. We tried 4 of them. In order of preference, we liked stoned to the bone, stranger than kindness, all night Nippon, in the bleak winter. 

Service =4.5 stars. Spot on and knowledgeable. Though we were only offered bar seats, there were empty tables during the whole course of our dinner, which was irksome.   

Ambiance = 5 stars. Speakeasy style. low lit with candles. You can pick from their old record collection to play the next song. Their bathroom smelled nice too.

Food =  3ish or so. 
We didn't realize the restaurant was not offering the full menu due to restaurant week. This made our selections certainly easy. The 3 of us tried everything on the RW menu but it would have been nice to not have to order 3 desserts. The 1st courses were not too enticing...not sure if I would have selected these out of a full menu...though the crab dip was decent. the 2nd courses were better - the scallops were perfectly cooked but only 2 in a plate so it was tricky to share among 3 people. The mild curry dish with cous cous was a hit more than the chicken which was slightly bland in comparison. Both desserts were okay but I preferred the bread pudding (small portions) over the ice cream. Not sure if there was much of a value in the RW menu especially since we had to get 3 desserts. 

Overall, I still had a good time and I would be open to coming back to try the regular menu.      

Note: the location is very remote. Also we were warned to remove any valuables from the car since their parking lot has been broken into lately."
ada-street-chicago,L. A. H.,"Yum yum yum! We sat at the bar durning Restaurant Week and had their special menu. We didn't know it was RW but they accommodated us anyway without a reservation. Charred broccoli, fired chicken, salmon, salted chocolate ganache - loved it all. Our cocktails were amazing too. Our waiter/bartender Chad was very attentive, nice, and friendly. The other servers were awesome as well. We will def try out the new Willow restaurant Chad told us about asap! This was our 4th visit and can't wait to return."
ada-street-chicago,Jamie L.,"Love the food. Love the atmosphere and spinning full records for tunes. Price was reasonable, though shareable portions are on the small side. Cocktails also a little small for price. But all makes up in flavor. Definitely a special treat. Our server was meh, but all in all we will be back!"
ada-street-chicago,Nicholas T.,"Ada Street delivered on the decor and thought that went into last nights special meal. If you didn't know, Ada did a Harry Potter themed meal. The decorations, people, staff were all amazing and were in character. That was awesome! The chef is very good as well!

For $160 for 2 tickets, the food was good, but pretty small. The app was a small salad or scotch egg, a 2nd dish of french onion or fried rice, then fish and chips / roast beef, and then a small dessert. The event probably increased the reg prices, and that was all fine and expected...The biggest frustration was we the chef is very good, but my gf has celiacs and the modifications weren't really modifications. It was just moving the gluten items off the plate. That didn't fully ruin the experience, and I would still recommend Ada, but as you can imagine thats pretty frustrating. They also had a special drink and special appetizer, and rather than giving her a different drink or a modified app, she just didn't get anything. That felt a little neglectful, since i believe everyone should get similar experiences. I will eventually come back to Ada street, but maybe not for a while."
ada-street-chicago,Kelly N.,"This is definitely my new favorite, go-to date night or out with friends place to go.  It's been on my list to try for awhile, but with young kids at home we tend to live under a rock ... until we don't and we have incredibly high expectations for anywhere that we go out to eat because it better be good if we're paying a babysitter for the evening.  

The location:  Love the off the beaten track location amongst a bunch of warehouses.  The outside is very non-descript and when you enter it is like another world.  

The vibe:  Inside the restaurant it is incredibly dark and I felt blind for the first 10 minutes as my eyes adjusted ... but it's also really dark.  We lucked out that they had just opened up the outdoor patio which was a nice modern industrial feel with vintage Edison bulb hanging lights.  Inside it's the same type of feel and pretty hipster.  So hipster in fact that you can pick out vinyl records to play through the restaurant ... kind of like a juke box but it's full size records and a real person.  They even have outkast on vinyl.  Impressive.  It's somewhere between casual and dressy ... probably a maxi dress or flowy romper for the ladies and dark jeans, hipster tee and jacket for the guys.

The drinks:  Amazeballs.  We tried 4 different cocktails and all of them were great.  I started with ""Be Nice to Me"" and then followed up with ""Stranger than Kindness"" - both highly recommend.  Also impressed that all of the staff is knowledgeable and able to recommend cocktails from the menu to suit your tastes.

The food:  Also really yummy.  The lamb ribs and the burrata to start then the scallops and sirloin as mains.  Great flavors particularly in the lamb ribs, but enjoyed the flavors and textures throughout the meal.  It's sharing plates so none of the dishes are that large - plan for ~2-3 per person.

The service:  Hipster to go with the vibe, but in a completely friendly and helpful yet down-to-earth way.  Loved how in-the-know everyone was about the menu.  Debating between two things, they can help guide you based on a description or hearing what you are looking for.  Really great staff all around."
ada-street-chicago,Angelica V.,"If I am upset with anything, it is with myself for not dining here sooner. Everyone and everything was perfection from start to finish. Andrea was fantastic and made us feel at home the entire time. 

We had the following: ceviche, shrimp chop salad, burrata, queso dip, black rice, and lamb skewers. It was ALL amazing. We would order all of it again. It was fairly priced too. 6 dishes, 4 drinks (all amazing)... $130. We left very satisfied. The best hole in the wall! 

Do yourself a favor and go there....even if it's once. You will not regret it."
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Sejal P.,"Came in on Sunday morning for brunch with 4 other girlfriends and we had amazing time.  Our bartender Chris was super friendly and made the brunch even more enjoyable.  I ordered the classic breakfast minus the sausage and bacon which they were so kind enough to substitute with asparagus. 

I highly recommend Earls if you're into brunches.  If for nothing else join for that bottomless mimosas!"
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Dema L.,"My friend & I stopped for a round of drinks during our shopping day. It was slow since it was 3pm on a weekday. The drink specials were good & the service was attentive. 
Our major problem was when the bartender came back from her small break; she took a wet towel from the sink area and proceeded to wipe her boots with it. This wet towel never made it to the dirty bin, wasn't washed/rinsed after being used. We kept watching to see what she does with it, she wiped the area under the mat with it. If there were more people, she might have wiped the bartop with it. 
5 steps away from her was a stack of clean and dry towels she could have replaced the wet towel with. From sanitary point of view, I will not be returning."
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Trisha A.,"My family and I came back a few weeks ago for my brother's birthday. I made the reservation about a week beforehand. We were seated promptly upon arriving. 

Food: I ordered the Curry dish with naan and coconut rice. It was really good! For not being an Indian restaurant, it tasted pretty authentic (don't quote me on that, I'm not a curry expert). 
My family enjoyed their dishes too, which consisted of the Steak + Sushi combo, Swordfish tacos, and Jamaican Jerk chicken. The only thing was that the bday boy said his medium rare steak (in the steak/sushi combo) was tough and not as good as he tried before during my birthday. 

The one star off was for the service again. Our waitress (Zoey I think?) was great but she didn't know it was my brother's birthday even though I put it on a note on Open Table. The hostess knew but it would be nice if they communicated that to our waitress. That way I wouldn't have to mention it again. Luckily, she let the birthday boy pick which dessert he wanted and was nice about me asking if it was complimentary (just checking!) Also, she took a while to remove a few plates before the dessert came.

Hope they can adjust some things that I've mentioned. Still can't wait to come back!"
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Ben B.,"An off night? I hope so.

Things were a little weird from the moment we arrived. Despite having a reservation and seeing lots of open tables, the host made us wait like 5 minutes before finally seating us. When we sat in a booth, she reached across the table to pick up some extra silverware and we were hit with a powerful cloud of B.O. 

Okay, reset. Give them another chance.

We began with queso fundido ($12), which was surprisingly bland. Although there was some chorizo on top, it was in huge balled-up clumps. Weird. Also, the ""salsa fresca"" it allegedly comes with was just three tiny tomato cubes. Well, we were starving so even bland food can tide a guy over.

For my main course, I ordered the 8 oz. steak frites ($19.50). While my steak was good, the fries were a total disaster. Ladies and gentlemen, I have identified the *worst* fries in Chicago.

Okay, imagine you're at Burger King and you show up a little too late after the lunch rush. The only fries left have been sitting out a while. They've turned brittle and a little stale. But because of your lousy timing, you get stuck with them. Like, an entire order of the potato shards normally found at the bottom of your bag. That's what Earl's fries tasted like.

I ate 3 or 4 and alerted our server that they were super overcooked, brittle, flavorless, and dry. (I almost never complain at restaurants, but these french fry abortions needed to be called out.) Our server brought a new order of fries. They were similarly overcooked, brittle, flavorless, and dry.

If you take a french fry and apply slight pressure to it, it shouldn't break apart like a dusty old mummy at the Field Museum. But these did. Every one. There was nothing soft on the inside. It's like they rammed these bastards in a food dehydrator, threw them in a toaster for five minutes too long and then sprinkled them with silica gel packets to remove any remaining moisture.

Good God, those fries were horrendous. Both times! Our server didn't offer another side or any kind of price adjustment.

The steak frites also come with something calling itself garlic bread. I wonder if there's a national garlic shortage because this was also lacking in the flavor department. It reminded me of the garlic bread you'd get in a school cafeteria.

The restaurant also seemed very understaffed. We had to flag down random servers for things like ketchup. After our appetizer, a busser took my wife's knife and fork, but they were never replaced.

To quote the Dixie Chicks, goodbye, Earl. I'm headed to the superior flavors, service, and atmosphere of Yard House two doors down."
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Chris M.,"Seeing that Earls serves a pretty wide variety of ethnic food, I never expect them to do a good job with all of them but, after eating here for my third time, they continue to surprise me and do just that. Last time I went, I ordered the Caesar salad and clam chowder with bread and all of it was great! Be aware that the clam chowder is chunky and not creamy (not sure what style of chowder that's called).

I got to have the Jeera Chicken Curry as well and it was a solid choice. We asked for it spicy so it was actually quite spicy and quite sour as well (lemon?), which I enjoyed. They do a great job with the naan too; you'd think you're at an Indian restaurant.

Besides the food, I'm a fan of the upscale contemporary feel of the restaurant, but keeping it casual with TVs showing sports at the bar. Also extra points for the trumpets on the wall (see photo)."
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Juan Rosalia T.,"My new favorite brunch place in town. It's so spacious, the food and the service are great!! Gonna bring my girls here again next time!!"
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Katrine G.,"This place became one of my fav spots for any occasion.
Best lunches and dinners with good prices and service! Everyone are always friendly and the place has a very warm vibe inside. Perfect for fiends company and a date! 
Love the tacos and deserts! 
On the pic- banana pudding with ice cream! It was delicious!"
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Michael I.,"Went here for brunch and really loved the food. I got a chorizo mushroom hash, which came with crispy potatoes, poached eggs, avocados, and hollandaise sauce. It was spectacular, especially with the Valentina hot sauce (ask for it on the side). The other dishes (especially the steak and eggs) also looked excellent. 

The service was awesome too. Our waitress checked on us relatively frequently and accommodated is well. Not sure how this happened, but all of our coffees ended up being free. And they had this crazy special where all the brunch meals were $8. So my entire brunch meal came out to less than $9 with tax. 

The steak and eggs for one of the girls at our party came out cold. She couldn't eat it. So they quickly cooked a fresh steak and eggs meal that was smoking and replaced that for her. The waitress also gave us all beignets with chocolate dipping sauce on the house. That is exactly what I'd expect from a restaurant that places importance on customer service. I would absolutely return."
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Sakif F.,"An okay spot that is primarily aimed for the brunch/cocktails crowd with some decent food. I got the steak and shrimp combo. The steak came out perfectly medium rare as I wanted, but was seriously lacking in flavor. The shrimp tasted boiled, and also lacked flavor. The mashed potatoes were pretty solid, and the fries were okay. Nothing worth writing home about."
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Henriette K.,"Love this place!

Super affordable, both for drinks and dinner and brunch on the weekend. Their food is really great, and their drinks are amazing!
Highly recommend the Tiki Torch and the Sriracha Margarita, sooo good !"
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Ryan B.,Very tasty! The menu was extremely diverse set in a nice contemporary atmosphere. I'll definitely be back here! 1/2 off bottles of wine on Thursday btw
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Leah S.,They get to keep 4 stars for my review because I do like it here but every once in awhile its a miss. We weren't super impressed by the food last night. Cocktails were great 5/5. My salad did not live up to my expectations. The veggies were a little sad. My husbands jerk chicken was moist but it was more like bbq chicken.
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Michael C.,"Just dropped by Earl's after a movie - bar seating was 1/2 full - there was a booth open @ the bar - asked the front desk if we could sit there (we had a 3 year old with us) - host said no but we could sit at a high top table - I said that wouldn't work with a 3 year old - host refused to let us seat at the booth
We left - I have been here many times before - live 2 blocks away - this is my last visit"
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Clare J.,"Ive been going to Earl's for a few months now and I cant get enough! First, they have amazing drink specials! Last month it was $5 Mojitos and this month Margaritas. Last night, I had the Sriracha Pineapple Margarita and it was amazing! I also had the Cheddar Bacon burger it was just ok.  The Garlic fries are always a win! I really need to explore their menu more because honestly we just come for the wings and cocktails. The wing flavors are good and they're not skimpy on the amount they give you. My fave thing about Earl's are the outside fire pits! Its super relaxing and you can really sit out their for hours with the fire keeping you warm! While there are so many options in New City, Earl's is a solid evening for any occasion you could possibly think of.."
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Kaley K.,"I was super impressed with the menu options at earls. There were all kinds of things to choose from which I LOVE when you're eating with a group. 

The brunch menu options are very good too! I ordered a bloody Mary to start. It was incredibly tasty! Slightly spicy and peppery which I love. 

For starters we ordered the queso funditdo. It was gooey and perfect with the chips. 

I had a burger. It was so good! My only complaint is that it was a little difficult to pick up and eat so it took some effort. 

I'd recommend coming here with a date just don't order the burger (for fear of being super messy) 

The space and vibe were super cool. There's outdoor seating which is perfect for the summer. 

I highly recommend this place!"
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Helen H.,"It was easy to make and change your reservation on  OpenTable. I think I had changed it about 4 times prior to our 6:45 reservation for 6 people on a Friday. We were able to be seated earlier with 2 people. I chose this place because their menu selection was really diverse.. noodles, burgers, meat, seafood. Something for everyone!

For the month of June, they're having $5 margaritas and on Fridays, $2 off signature cocktails! It worked out perfectly for our group dinner. I ordered a Bloody Mary, and she made sure to ask me if I wanted the one that would be included in the $2 off. Honestly, I still don't understand what the difference was, but apparently there are two types of Bloody Mary's you can order and one doesn't qualify for the Friday special. Double check with your server to the one that's included in the special. I appreciated that she tried to help me save me money. The Forager Burger was delicious. It's a veggie burger and so filling. I packed half of it to go home. 

This place is perfect for groups, and the menu has something for everyone. It's nice inside like a upscale hotel lobby, and I wasn't expecting that so I felt a little underdressed for the restaurant. I felt like the service was slightly slow, but the waitress explained that there was a rehearsal dinner going on. So anticipate slightly delayed service from the kitchen when they have large events."
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Xuan M.,"Came here for lunch on a Tuesday!

 Beautiful interior, decently priced lunch menu, and the flavors are mediocre.

The only thing I wanted on the menu was sold out (not sure why as we were one of the three tables there) and I got the second best thing which was an asian inspired hunan shrimp stir fry. My boyfriend had a burger which he thought was decent, but my stir fry was dark, and not very vibrant which did not help with my appetite.

Not sure if we will be back again, but this was a nice option to have if you are looking for an ok food place with nice interior in new city"
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Shan M.,"Awful food
Sauces and water is the best
Nice service 
expensive Menu 
Overall OK
I don't recommend this place 
Zabiha Halal chicken"
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Keisha H.,"Late writing this.... So me and mom were running errands and we knew we were going to have to grab food. I had seen this place on one of my trips in that area but hadn't had a chance to go yet. No its not a michelin rating going but sometimes even the semi-chain restaurants get 5 stars!
Greeting and seating as soon as we entered. It was late afternoon so the crowd wasnt bad and the weather was amazing so we were lucky to get an outdoor table. 

Our waitress was personable very knowledgeable about the menu and was just the right amount of attentive. She was also very cute and fly in her outfit :) I had a glass of prcessco which was great and we both order the black bean and corn salad with avocado, dates (added just the right amount of sweetness) crispy wontons mine with blacked shrimp moms with blacked chicken. This salad was amazing. Yes a place named  Earls Kitchen and bar had one of the best salads I have had in a LONG time. We also shared a basked of truffle fries. I have never really tasted a bad potato. 

Must say I will try Earls again not sure if it will be for other items on the menu but definitely want to taste this salad again."
earls-kitchen-bar-chicago,Britt N.,"We decide to go her before second city, mainly because they had many gluten free options. We were surprisingly surprised! The atmosphere was perfect, large comfy rounded booths with modern decor. I read some bad reviews but we had excellent food, drinks and service! They also had happy hour going on.. $7 mojitos and Mules we had :) highly recommend the salmon and Cajun chicken. Will defiantly return!"
the-matchbox-chicago,Scarlett T.,"I'm from Owensboro, Kentucky, visiting my daughter. Matchbox is rare and impressive. Fresh ingredients for cocktails. Does anyone even do that anymored! Delicious!"
the-matchbox-chicago,Stephanie L.,"What's not to love about one of the shadiest, shitty, small bars in chicago that serves up some excellent cocktails?!

Love this place.  The bartenders are fun, but they don't want to hear your crap.  I love them.  They play excellent tunes and can whip up just about anything.

It's also a given that in the very small space, you will run into some characters...some good and some bad.  BUT EVERYTIME, I love it."
the-matchbox-chicago,Julie S.,"Contrary to popular belief, this is not the oldest or the smallest bar in Chicago. I'm sure it comes pretty close though. The place is across the street from the Chicago blue line stop, but very easy to miss. Luckily, I only came with one friend, because there wasn't room for more. It's divey and dark, and the bar itself fills most of the space. The bartender was friendly, but service was a little slow. Most of the small crowd seemed to know each other. Their beer and liquor selection is decent with reasonable prices. It's a no-frills kind of place. We only stayed for one drink, because who needs more than one chartreuse drink? Overall, not a bad time."
the-matchbox-chicago,Kel W.,"The Matchbox is just simply amazing all around. It is absolutely tiny but it's in the name... you know what you are getting yourself into. AND, for how small it is, seats always seem to open up for you to use. Don't bring a group of friends bigger than 4-5 and even that's a little generous. Amazing cocktails, awesome music, decent prices, lovely bartenders. A perfect neighborhood and Chicago bar. I think the rest of the reviews here pretty much tell you everything you need to know. Love you Matchbox!"
the-matchbox-chicago,Alex S.,"This isn't a dive bar, this is THE dive bar.

It's tiny, it's dark, the drinks are cheap and strong and you know you're going to have a good time. 

This spot is right near my house and apparently had been around since the 30's. When I mentioned to someone that I went there, they responded with: ""That place is still open?""

It is.

I have a feeling I know why it's called The Matchbox, as it's smaller than any bar I may have ever been into, and only gets smaller as you walk in and the walls narrow. One row of seats right up against the bar, where there's one very friendly bartender working. I got a three floyds beer and it was damn delicious. 

It's not shiny or new, but it is special."
the-matchbox-chicago,Eric P.,"Worst bartender in the world. 
Seriously.  I took out a couple of VIPs in order to ""impress them"" and take them to one of my favorite places that I hadn't been to in years. 
There were about 20 people in the place, it took us 15 minutes to place our order, and another 15 minutes to get our drinks. Tried to re-order drinks half an hour later, waited another 15 minutes and he said he forgot about our order. WTF?!? 
Never will I go there again. Angry. This used to be such a great place."
the-matchbox-chicago,Allie H.,"Excellent little dive bar, come early to get a seat, there are only 17! Powder sugar rims on the cocktails is genius! Get the Sidecar - best in town!"
the-matchbox-chicago,Reg B.,"Great little bar... and I mean little... this is my sort of bar, divey, dark, good barman and stiff drinks at a good price... i would have stayed here for the whole night.. lets be honest... there was about 8 in the bar and it was a struggle to get to the toilet... but oh so worth it! if in the neighbourhood, drop in for sure..."
the-matchbox-chicago,Chris S.,"Excellent place. Was recommended by Jeremiah (sp) from Twisted Spoke to see ""Tony"" and to try the Margaritas. I'm glad I did. The place is very small and intimate. The drinks are delicious and I was told that you can order food from bar next door and have it brought in. Place looks like it has much history behind it and I would not be surprised if I go back in there again and make it a night. Definitely will be back."
the-matchbox-chicago,Josh E.,"My wife and I live in west town and love to patronize local joints. Stopped in the matchbox for a quick drink, and were served promptly by Ryan, a nice fella with a dark beard and glasses. His partner, a burly guy with a red beard and sleeve tats comes in and takes over bar operations. My beer empties and I try to flag down red beard. Now if you've ever been to this bar, you know he doesn't have a lot of real estate to cover, yet somehow this gentleman can't seem to spot me sitting dead center of the bar on a slow Monday night. I wait patiently for ten more minutes as he mixes a few cocktails and I attempt to flag him down as he passes right in front of me three more times. My wife finishes her glass of wine, and I say it's time to go. Left a 25% tip which I should have earmarked for Ryan, but didn't feel like having a conversation with lumber jagoff. 

Now I'm not sure of the reason for this discrimination, but if I had to guess, I would say it was because my wife and I didn't fit in with the second bartender's particular taste in alternative fashion. Perhaps my button-up shirt and her casual dress were offensive to his tastes.  Whatever the reason, it made for a poor first and last impression of a place I really wanted to like. 

Good business starts with good people, and I'm afraid I expect the bar staff at a neighborhood hole-in-the-wall to bat better than .500 in that department. The good news is that there are plenty of other good spots around west town to spend my beer money. Red beard, you had one job. You're a disgrace to the industry."
the-matchbox-chicago,Raymond K.,"I told my friend about this place and said that she had to go and see it, I was there many years ago and I remember it being a cool place.
I ordered two well vodka and tonic drinks and was charged $9.00 each, $18.00 for well vodka!
WTF!
I won't go back there again.
Pissed off in Chicago."
the-matchbox-chicago,Sara H.,"Amazing neighborhood, literal hole in the wall Chicago bar. It's the size of a matchbox - with seating for about ~15 people max. Along with the unusual sized place, what makes this place unique is there cocktail menu. No frills, no BS, just the old school classics simply put on a chalkboard wall. The Silver Palm next door allows you to order food from their menu and they'll bring it over to you at the bar. I only drank, but would be interested to know how the food is also.

Overall, great casual spot for classic drinks. My boyfriend and I live near this spot and I can't wait to go back and try more from their menu."
the-matchbox-chicago,Ruggy J.,"If you're a fan of stiff classic cocktails like a Manhattan, you're going to get along just fine with The Matchbox. 

Right in River West, this is another bar in Chicago I've been to countless times, yet somehow never gotten around to reviewing it. Tsk tsk. 

There's not much for breathing room inside, as it's a tiny sliver of a place. Who knows what the square footage is, but one thing's for sure; you only have about three feet between the wall and the bar. If you don't mind tight spaces, you'll be fine. Claustrophobic bar goers may want to take some anti anxiety medication before agreeing to meet anyone for drinks on a Friday or Saturday night... 

Always a fun soundtrack, friendly bartenders, and never once have I been disappointed with a cocktail. If you haven't been, I suggest you change that ASAP."
the-matchbox-chicago,Brandon K.,"Neat place, sort of a novelty, but certainly worth a quick visit if you're in the area."
the-matchbox-chicago,June Y.,"Literally a hole in the wall. This place is tiny and made a little person like myself slightly claustrophobic. I truly wonder how grown men can sit elbow to elbow like sardines and have a good time. The alcohol probably helps...
Only one bartender that doesn't seem too chipper. He seemed pretty shocked that we ordered straight shots and the concept of shot glasses also don't exist in his world. He pretty much served us a half a glass of vodka each (equivalent to at least 2 shots). The shot in itself was also warm and did not go down smoothly. We also tried their Dark and Stormy which was AVERAGE and their banana daiquiri which was borderline undrinkable. Wouldn't go back or recommend."
the-matchbox-chicago,Michael W.,"One of the best local bars in river west neighborhood and Chicago in general. My wife and I visit regularly(not alcoholics) but the bartender/GM, Tony, always remembered us. Good selection of beers(not those weird crafts) and great mixed drinks. My wife says they have the best Cosmo in the city. Smaller place but that give it the character. Prices are excellent as well"
the-matchbox-chicago,Allison J.,"It's small. It's a bar.

They have a few beers on tap and they are more unique options, which was nice to try. 
Lots of rye, whiskey and bourbon options for people that like those drinks. They have a TV, but since it's so small in there you really have to strain your neck to get a view of it. 

All in all, I would stop back in if I were in the area, but I'm not settling up weekly visits any time soon."
the-matchbox-chicago,Megan M.,"Loved it here.  People aren't kidding - this place is tiny!  Maybe 15 or so bar stools and limited standing space.  Regardless, it was a great atmosphere and incredible drinks.  I ordered the vodka gimlet - it was delicious!  Highly recommend checking this place out - I will definitely be back."
the-matchbox-chicago,Josh M.,"This place has it all:

Small: Yup

Cheap Drink options: Check

Surly Bartender: Fo Sho

Gents who appear to be regulars looking at you funny because you wore a cardigan sweater: Indeed that happened.

Overall good time: You Bet Your A$$$"
the-matchbox-chicago,Stacy P.,"This place is definitely small, or should I say narrow.  I stopped in before happy hour though, so I was able to nab a seat.  Right in front of the show too (where the bartender mixed up fine concoctions that had me at hello).  It's dark and a great place to come if you just don't feel like dealing with the world or the hassle of a busy trendy bar.  The cocktails are on point, and I did get checked for my ID.  Kudos to the bartender for being on the right side of the law.  The music brought me back to a time before I was 21... Portishead.  I actually stayed longer because I felt like I was in a perfect time warp.  A few creepers straggled in, but I kept to myself and then ordered a Please and Thank You.  Rightful moniker too, I would have followed it with a ""yes SIR, may I have another!!, "" but it's still mid day and I had to drive home.  It tasted creamy and gingery.  If I had to date a drink, it would be this one.  Bourbon, brandy, apple pie shrub, demerara, lemon, and ginger beer.  Topped with citrus peel, and the straw right through.  I am for sure coming back, probably around the same time, as I've seen other yelpers having difficulty grabbing a seat later.  #doyouevenmatchboxbro  Yes, yes I do.  btw, there are no ""bros"" here, thank the lord."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Kat A.,"This review is just based on carry out orders. I've eaten at the restaurant but can't really remember my experience (it was good but I don't remember the details)
I ordered both the Tom Yum Kai  and Tom Ka Kai soups while I had a bad cold. Both these soups helped me survive my awful cold.  I ordered both at a medium-hot spice level which was perfect to clear out my nose.  I loved that the soups had pieces of lemongrass (and ginger too I believe) so I knew it wasn't just some watered down soup like you get at a lot of Asian restaurants.  They both had great flavors...I could actually taste it despite my stuffed up nose.  They had plenty of chicken in both soups.  

Now I have a new go-to place when I want some hot and spicy soup on these cold winter days."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Grace K.,"Why? what happened? MY other experience with your sister restaurant was so good? Have I changed? Have you changed. Yea, it's probably you not me.

SWEEEETTTT everything was too sweet. Pad thai too sweet, too salty, noodles soggy. 

green papaya salad one dimensional... salty fish + spice meh meh meh

This is the place that ends up on your speed dial because they are responsive and makes mediocre food on time.. and you are in a jam."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Tam N.,"I gotta update my review because my god, they have such a good and inexpensive duck curry. It's only $9.99 and it includes rice!!! Plenty of duck in there and the curry itself is delicious. I've never seen duck curry been so inexpensive before. 

The kuay tiew khee mao was pretty disappointing though. The amount of noodles were scarce, though they did have a lot of tofu.. But  if I order a noodle dish, i'd expect more noodles than the protein.. this was disappointing.

The c31 Neum Num Tok salad ($8.59) was delicious as well. Tartness from the lime worked well with the steak. Warning though, their spicy felt like extra extra spicy.. which deterred my fully enjoying this dish. I would definitely get it again but as a mild if anything."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Ryan B.,Best pad thai I've had in a long time! There are various locations throughout the city. So glad they opened so close to where I live!
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Carolina N.,"My go-to Thai place in the neighborhood! 

Everything is amazing. I am obsessed with the pad thai, pad see iew, khao soy, and gaeng panang. I also love their crab rangoon and egg rolls! 

I love both dining in and ordering delivery from Opart. I also really like that they are vegetarian friendly!"
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Sarah S.,"Opart Thai House is the biggest Thai spot I've ever! The space is huge, really nice and there is even a huge space with a glass ceiling so it's pretty and has a lot of natural light.

My friend and I dined here over the weekend and were surprised to be just one of three tables in this immense space. It seems they do a lot of takeout though, which makes sense. 

The menu has a lot of good options including tasty curries but I was feeling basic and went with chicken pad thai & crab rangoon. I have to say their crab rangoon was one of the best I've ever had. It had such great flavor & was so creamy. I would go back just for their crab rangoon! The Pad Thai, on the other hand, I was not a big fan of. Something in the flavor seemed a bit off and the noodles even seemed a bit different than the usual. Nothing wrong with being different than the norm, but it just wasn't different in a good way for me. It wasn't bad by any means though, I took my leftovers home and gobbled it all up...so it couldn't have been that bad!

Service was prompt & friendly throughout and that crab rangoon! I will definitely go back but try a different main dish."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Kateryna G.,"The food: 5/5. I only tried the seafood combo and it was delicious. I asked for spicy and spicy it was, it definitely made me sweat. If you can't tolerate the heat, ask for none because even mild is fairly spicy. 

The service: 3/5. There were 3 people at the check in desk, but only one person serving all the tables. It took a while to get a water refill. 

Overall: 4/5. Good Thai option on Chicago Ave, I'll be back."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Denisha B.,"This review is based on one dish only that took my breathe away...Massam Curry! They do it beyond well here. It was perfect and the best that I've had in the city. I've eaten at a great amount of thai restaurants that prepare this dish and they haven't come close to making it like this. Granted, I still need to eat my way through the city to determine in fact if these peeps have the number one spot, but thus far they do. 

If you don't know what Massam Curry is...it's a coconut curry dish with peanuts, meat, and potatoes. I did add chicken in mine. It wasn't super spicy which I was fine with because I actually wanted to enjoy my dish and it came super hot in temperature. It's always a pet peeve of mine when my food doesn't arrive hot. They also give you a nice amount that you can have for dinner and lunch. 

My friend and I decided to do take out instead of dine in because we just wanted to be in doors. It literally takes them about 10 minutes to prepare your food which is nice. Again, when we got home our food was still hot. My friend ordered the Green Curry with beef which had a nice flavor but it was so spicy (and I LOVE SPICE) that I couldn't even enjoy it. If you decide to go with the other curries, be sure to indicate your spice level so that they can adjust it for you. Also, the green curry didn't come with bamboo shoots which we love. They are priced at normal price for thai food in the city (our curry dishes came to about 10 bucks and some change). 

All in all, would I go back? Hell yes! I might go back tonight for some curry and to try some other dishes."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Rachel S.,Ordered deliver from here recently and it was really tasty.  I can't remember the name of the dish I ordered but it was a spicy ground chicken dish with veggies.  It was fantastic and you get a really nice portion of meat with rice on the side.  I'd definitely order again.
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Jeff H.,"We went to Opart the other night during a snowstorm and it was the perfect food during a cold night.
We had several curry dishes and the flavor was rich and complex. Can't wait to go back!"
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Kevin G.,"My wife and I ate dinner here last night and we will definitely be back. We had a reservation for 7:00 p.m. on a Saturday night and the place was packed. We were glad that we made a reservation as the restaurant was so busy that there were no free tables until 9:30 p.m.

Given that it was crowded, the restaurant was a bit noisy. Luckily, we got a booth and were able to sit directly next to each other, so there were no issues with being able to carry on a conversation.  As an appetizer, we had the crab rangoon. Without a doubt, this was the best crab rangoon we have ever had.  

For our entrees, we both had the pad thai with shrimp and it was very good.  I have seen some of the reviews saying that this dish tends to be too sweet or salty. I couldn't disagree more. The amount of sweetness was just right and the noodles were tasty. For dessert, we had the Thai custard, which tastes similar to bread pudding, and it was very good.

The service was good as the greeter in the front was very nice and our waitress (despite being busy) checked on us frequently.  Also, the prices are very reasonable.

If you are looking for a good spot for date night and good food, this is the place for you."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Anmy V.,"A spacious Thai restaurant w $9 pad Thai and #74 chicken & green beans! Comes with rice! So good!!! 

Candle in the middle of the table. Decorative curtains. Square wooden tables. Such a cute date spot!

Hot spice level left my lips tingling. It was great for me, an avid XX hot cheetos fanatic.

Would recommend!!"
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Michael C.,"Opart Thai house is the most consistently good thai restaurant i've had in Chicago thus far. It's one of my family's go to restaurants, especially since it's super vegetarian friendly with every entree option allowing you to sub out meat for tofu! My favorite dishes are the peanut sauce lover and the basil chicken. I don't think you can go wrong with stir fry drenched in savory + sweet peanut sauce. The basil chicken is tasty and always packs the perfect amount of heat. Never had a complaint about the service here.


There are a couple of things that could use some work. I've had almost every one of their curries and they usually only come with basil and the protein of your choice. I think there ought to be added vegetables in there because although the sauce base is delicious, it would go way better with some more ingredients. Also, portion sizes are good but not great. All in all opart thai is a great restaurant and from what I've seen seems like a hopping place for take out too."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Jess D.,"Thai is my favorite food and this is some of the best I've ever had. New favorite Thai spot in Chicago. We went during the day Sunday and it had a laid back, quiet atmosphere. Highly recommend the khao soi! Great portion sizes (can be enough for 2 meals) for the price."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Heily N.,"Bad service.
The food is not authentic. 
The soup was too sour.
Curry was too sweet and not spicy at all even when I ordered medium spicy."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Amy H.,"Let's be real. I love this place. We eat here almost once a week, but definitely every other week. Everyone we've taken has loved it as well. One of the best inexpensive places in the neighborhood. Happy to have them nearby."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Hiep T.,"Honestly, I am not a fan of this place. I am obsessed with the Opart near Chinatown; as a result, I thought that the quality of the food should be the same for ALL Oparts. However, I was wrong. My friends and I decided to stop by at this location since we were already in the area. The curry, soups, and the Pai Thai were not up to par. Curry is supposed to be creamy and thick, not bland and liquidy like the one that we got.  

The Tom Yum soup was too strong on the flavoring. They went a little bit overboard with the spices (so salty). The Tiger cry was the only decent dish of the night, however, one decent dish does not make up for the other three dishes. As a result, I won't be coming back to this location again, but I will be back for the Opart in Chinatown. This place is so much bigger than the other Oparts, and on top of that, they have their own bar. However, the restaurant does not seem lively."
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Nina I.,"I wish I could give 10 stars!!!
This is the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to! Positively the most delicious Thai food I've ever had!! The atmosphere was wonderful, the interior had a perfect balance of color and decor with wide opening windows for a perfect breeze and a spacious layout that was very comfortable. The timing of the service was perfect, and the prices are beyond reasonable. I can't wait to return here for more of their delicious foods and drink!!
To start we ordered the Thai iced tea, a go-to of mine, which was so delicious I wanted 10 more!! The flavor of the tea was very strong, something I LOVE, but don't get enough of elsewhere. (everywhere else always seems to be overly sweet with very little actual tea flavor)
Next, appetizers: We ordered their signature dish Tiger Cry, which was phenomenal! Smoky and sweet, with a kick in their sauce, a flavor depth you will crave, time and time again. -A short backstory on this, the name was translated incorrectly on the menu when they first opened, true translation ""Crying Tiger"" but since they'd just opened, they didn't have the funds to reprint all the menus to correct this mistake. Later, this dish became one that they're known for, and the name, specifically theirs :)
Also off their appetizer list we ordered the Fried Tofu which was perfectly fried and came with a perfect pairing sauce that I simply couldn't get enough of. 
The Pad Thai with shrimp was done perfectly! The shrimp was cooked perfectly, the noodles were the absolute perfect texture, the flavors were incredible- an absolutely outstanding dish and certainly recommended to all!!
The Tom Ka Koong (a variation to the menu) Tom Ka is like the well known Tom Yum soup but made with coconut milk. Koong is shrimp.. they offer on the menu a Tom Ka Kai, which is chicken, but I prefer the broth of shrimp and asked if they could accommodate. They were pleased to do so, and the dish was wonderful, exactly how I'd hoped, absolutely divine. 
The Basil fried rice with ground chicken, a common dish is Thailand, was incredible! We ordered it 'hot' (spicy) and it was definitely spicy enough to satisfy anyone who likes it HOT, but order it mild if you have more sensitive tastebuds ;)
To end on a sweet note we ordered the Thai Custard which was without complaint, a perfect way to end our meal. Made with Taro, this dish was very mild and sweet enough to satisfy that sweet- end of meal- craving. 
All in all, I absolutely adore this restaurant and will return, definitely!- time and time again..!!"
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Kathleen G.,LITERALLY terrible Thai food! I've never had pad Thai with zero taste and flavor. The noodles had no sauce at all and we're very disappointed since we're from out of town. The tom yum soup was sour and did not taste good. Not one person was satisfied
opart-thai-house-chicago-2,Michael C.,"I eat Thai food quite often, perhaps too often.  Being from NYC, I assumed I got the best Thai in the country.   I was wrong.  We started with Tiger Cry- marinated, grilled flank steak- to die for.   The Tom Yum soup was spicy, sour and flavorful beyond compare.  I usually don't eat basil sauce with beef, but this version with ground beef beats them all.  The green curry with chicken was think, sweet and spicy.  As it should be!   Taro custard and sweet sticky rice finished off this delightful meal.  I need to make another trip to Chicago!"
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Taylor C.,"Food - wow, I've eaten a lot of sandwiches but I can honestly say these were some of the best sandwiches I've ever tried. Best part is how generous they are with the meat portions. Worst part is trying to make a decision on which sandwich to order. Also, the meatballs and meat & cheese cone were on point. We really went all out - like Thanksgiving portions - when we ordered. This is the smart move for your 1st time here but you really only need one sandwich to do the trick. 

Drank - FREE WATER!!! No Booze here my friends. 

Ambiance - beautiful woodwork in this newly rehabbed establishment. Plenty of ingredients and the like that one could shop for during their brief time waiting for their order. Really fine looking deli. 

Service - immaculate! Anytime there's free samples the service starts out highly rated but the people working there were full of smiles and very insightful when it came to meat."
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Nikhil R.,"Great service, friendly staff and really accommodating to our requests. We ordered the Dante and Qx2 salad along with the eggplant appetizer. Their menus look seasonal (which is a good thing!)
The chef was kind enough to instruct his staff to serve some samples of mustard and horseradish on our request.
The sandwich hit the spot, Nduja aioli was hands down the kicker. The salad had a lovely crunch of the sun-chokes chips and hearty portion of Quinoa, avocado and beets. Albeit the bread that came along with the eggplant appetizer was a tad too crisp, the overall plate was a compete flavor-bomb.
I highly recommend this place for a quick lunch during the week. They also deliver through caviar but call in to confirm."
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Tanner J.,"Great little deli that is new to the neighborhood. It was recommended from my barber and I'm glad I stopped in. They have 5 or 6 different sandwich options and the 2 I ordered for my wife and I were both excellent. Plenty of space for a deli if you wanted to set up a laptop and get some work done which is nice. To top it all off, they have handmade gelato. What more could you ask for?!

Very friendly staff. I'll definitely be back."
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Jennie C.,"I was excited about this place because they offer a type of cured meat we had in Florence, so we came in on a Saturday to get some meats and also grab lunch. Hubby got the Dante and I got the south side Johnny. They were nothing like the sandwiches we've enjoyed in Italy. While the ingredients were top notch, they just didn't go together. The baguette, though with excellent crust, caused the Dante to instantly fall apart because it's too crusty for a sandwich. The south side Johnny was incredibly greasy and salty. The sandwiches in Italy had the right type of bread, perfect ratio of cured meats and creamy mozzarella that translated into a bit that is well balanced in flavor and texture, I've never had an over salted sandwich there. We Americans have lots to learn in the culinary arts."
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Julie S.,"This place is a great addition to the neighborhood. 

Their cases at the counter are filled with a great variety of meats and cheeses on one side, and gelato on the other. The menu of charcuterie boards, sandwiches, and salads is written on a chalk board above. You can taste a sample to help you decide what to order. Since I don't love red meat, I picked the B. Franklin which has turkey, avocado, cheddar and a few other treats on sourdough. It was surprisingly a little spicy, but delicious, and much better than the average deli turkey sandwich. I ended up getting a hunk of cheese to take home too because who doesn't need extra cheese? I got my food to go, but there are also a few cozy tables if you want to eat there. 

The staff is friendly and the prices are reasonable. I can see Tempesta becoming one of my go-to lunch spots."
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Wayne H.,"Quality meats (and prices to match).  I had the Dante sandwich which was loaded with italian meats - the fruit side turned out to be just a whole mandarin orange, arancini, side pasta salad (quite salty), and gelato (good)."
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Seth M.,"I can not speak highly enough about Tempesta! I've now been 3 times in under 2 weeks and will probably be back within the week. For breakfast I had the Potato-Nator and it's one of the best breakfast sandwiches I've ever had (I'be already been back for it). 

I also came and had them put together a simple charcuterie platter for me. He asked what I liked and then kind of took if from there. I had some very impressed friends and I just wanted to go back and try even more things!! I'd specifically recommend he Pork and Pistachio Pate, the Calibrian Pate, The capricola, and the soprasatta. 

I'll be back soon to try the Dante sandwich and the St genero!!"
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Stephanie L.,"I love me some delicious sausage...wink wink wink.
I love that this little shop has come to the hood.  

1.  The staff is amazing.  The girl that was at the counter was friendly. She offered suggestions and comments, but wasn't pushy.  It was a great friendly vibe when you walk into a New overwhelming venue!

2.  The food...yum, yum in my tum tum.
Marinated eggplant-yes.  Garlicky, buttery, with a slight tartness...slathered on grilled bread with a hint of roasted red peppers...might've been the best thing we had.  
Njuda arancini-fried balls of heaven with a little kick and I'm not talking about my Saturday night with my hubby.  These arancini were great.  The crunchy outside fried balls were fantastic and when cut into oozed out delicious cheesy, rice, njuda juices.  
meatballs-loved the texture of these bad boys.  Just the right amount of girth to them.  And I tasted the fresh basil in every bite.  Not to mention, there was a slight bit of heat in every bite that I enjoyed.
St Gennaro-it was good...just not great.  The ingredients were all good, but the sausage links on the sandwich didn't really work for us.  It just didn't make sense.  Either put it on a hot dog style bun or make the meat a different shape to fit the burger bun.  I think we ordered wrong...I wanted the Dante but my pussy husband is scared of spice...but next time, we are getting this one!

3.  The gelato looks AH-MAZ-ING.  If it wasn't -2 in Chicago, I probably would have went for it.

4.  What a great shop to grab meats, cheeses, etc

I'll be back...definitely to get the Dante and lord knows what else, probably some gelato once it's not negative degrees in Chicago."
tempesta-market-chicago-4,C C.,Whoa! So good. Just get the turkey sandwich and the chocolate chip cookie . This will not be disapointed!!!
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Alan D.,"It starts with N'duja and ends with N'don't'ja because you're so full from eating very good cured meats and sandwiches. I'm so glad this place opened. It's a terrific Italian deli with artisanal meats and some cheeses. Their specialty is N'duja, he spreadable spicy sausage from Sicily. We shared the Dante sandwich which was a kind of Italian sub. Small menu for now. Lots more to come, I'm sure."
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Jennifer S.,"This place just opened up on December 1st. I love meats and cheeses so I knew I had to come here. I parked right outside and grabbed the meat cone and qx2 salad to go. The place is small with seating space. There's a display of all the meats and sides (artichokes, olives etc) and another display of gelato. All looked amazing! In the back they have drinks and things you can buy to go (sauces). The meat cone was delicious! Had a variety of 3 meats. Unfortunately she didn't place a crostini or cheese like the menu said. The salad was phenomenal. Nice and fresh. It had Quinoa, cauliflower and radishes.  I can't wait to try their sandwiches!"
tempesta-market-chicago-4,J R.,"I went in with an open mind because I know they just opened, asked them to point me in the right direction of their pre-made dishes to take home. The woman recommended a side pasta dish. Sounded good....so I went with her suggestion. The pasta was way too salty, had too many unnoticeable of unusual flavors and the meat being 'smoked' was overpowering and it left a terrible aftertaste on your tongue. Poor recommendation on her part. I wont be returning for their pre-made dishes but willing to give the meat/cheese boards a try, in hopes for a better result."
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Lisa P.,"I was really excited to try out this new deli and it greatly exceeded my expectations. We were immediately greeted by the owner who came out from behind the counter to explain everything to us and offered samples of their famous sausage spread (it was amazing). 

There isn't a lot of seating but we were able to grab a table and enjoy the delicious lunch. Everything was amazing and the owner came to check on us multiple times. The entire staff was extremely nice and made us feel like we were family. 

I grabbed a rice crispie treat for dessert and it was one of the best I've ever had. I can't wait to go back!"
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Kat E.,"Saw other menu items that I look forward to trying next time (specifically the meatballs). Just moved to Chicago from New Jersey and have been unimpressed with the sandwich/deli shops selection and quality here. However, I'm very very pleased to have found this spot. I think the muffuletta may have been a special for the day; it was amazing and a must try for anyone who enjoys marinated olives."
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Kelly K.,"Delicious fresh ingredients, specialty cured meats, sandwiches that are truly fantastic.  A fantastic addition to the nearby neighborhood.  Surely to gain popularity & recognition.  Go now!"
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Kyle P.,This place is excellent in all aspects.  The Dante was one of the best sandwiches I have eaten in the city.  The staff was talking to everyone and cared.  Unique cuts made in house and gelato..... Oh and tasted their version of the rice crispy treat.   There is Rosemary in it....uh good.  Come here
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Brooke O.,Everything was fantastic! I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu. Definitely check it out. And save room for some gelato! I'm already looking forward to my next trip.
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Danielle K.,"I was really excited to hear about a market like this in the neighborhood. I'm always on the hunt for a great sandwich. The Southside Johnny sounded and tasted delicious with its pickled fennel, but it was The Dante that ended up winning me over with its spicy kick. We went back the weekend after to try the 'nduja arancini, which I highly recommend - a spicy version reminiscent of my Italian grandma's homemade arancini! Again, we went back the weekend after that for gelato. I tried a few flavors and loved the hazelnut (nocciola). I would have gone back the weekend after that if I wasn't out of town!"
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Kevin H.,"This place is great! awesome owner, great charcuterie plates. be sure to try their chocolate chip cookie, it's amazing."
tempesta-market-chicago-4,Martin S.,"Great place to pay a little extra for  a great sandwich. Good meats, good bread and good service. Seating is limited and the seating they do have could have been laid out a little better. Looks to be communal so just grab a spot."
g-and-o-chicago,AL B.,"Brunch! $5 Bloody Marys- that are good- not just a mix and some alcohol. 
Chicken and Waffles- the waffles are super light and fluffy with a touch of cinnamon... so good!! Chicken nice and moist- hit the spot! 
Also had some healthy choices- nice menu selection! 
A few tables but comfortable- not overly loud- playing classic great music choices- inxs- ah wonderful start to a Saturday!"
g-and-o-chicago,Thom S.,"Hey this is a great joint to grab a drink. I have to say that the bartender was super friendly and willing to give us a taste of various drinks before ordering. He even share an anecdote about a past girl he was dating and the ""Alabama Shake"" that she ordered. 

Great atmosphere and solid mixology of cocktails. We did not try the food as we were waiting to get to out diner plans. I highly recommend for a tasty libation and chill atmosphere."
g-and-o-chicago,Christopher T.,"So this place is really hit-or-miss. It's either really busy and servers overworked.. or there's like no one there and they're actually pretty quick. 

Food was average. But prices were a little higher than average. Also the thing that really put them into 2-Star territory was charging me $2 for ice."
g-and-o-chicago,Nancy S.,My first time here and I found the place really chill. I had the veggie hash and it was very yummy! My partner had the chicken and waffles and said it was good. I had my bloody Mary which was delicious. The staff was chill with a sense of humor. Def a millennial relaxed kind of vibe. The art was pretty dope as well. This is my kind of place. I will come back for a visit soon.
g-and-o-chicago,Carolina N.,"I liked G&O, but didn't love it. 

We ordered a salad, grilled cheese with the tomato soup, and mac & cheese. Everything was pretty decent, but nothing to write home about. The cocktail I ordered was really tasty, and the ambiance could have been chill if the drunk bros in the corner would stop screaming over each other. 

Anyway, my experience was only 3 stars because I thought the portions were small for the price, and also because we felt rushed to order and rushed to go. Our drinks & food all came out within like 10 minutes. I think our whole dining experience was like a half hour, and nothing was making me feel like I wanted to stay for another drink. 

I'd like to come back for brunch when the weather is nice and the patio is open."
g-and-o-chicago,Luna R.,"Had brunch on a Sunday - The service was good, the food was good too and the atmosphere is very hipster and fun; there was some Notorious BIG, Bruno Mars playing and two hipster looking bartenders having a good time. Will definitely be going back."
g-and-o-chicago,Kate H.,"Decent casual spot-came here with some friends after another event nearby and it was good.  It was pretty empty for a Friday night, and the music was pretty loud for such a small crowd so that was a downside.  Service was attentive from start to finish, and our server was helpful in giving advice on beers to have.  

I ordered the mac and cheese, which isn't really so much the gooey mac and cheese that everyone thinks of and is more of a cheese pasta (Corinne from the Bachelor, anyone?), but it was still good.  The Hell or High Watermelon beer was also good, though a little bit different.  Prices were also reasonable.  My friend also enjoyed her burger, and there seemed to be many good options on the menu.  Also a bonus, they had a phone charger behind the bar for my friend to charge her phone!  If I was in the area I'd stop by there again."
g-and-o-chicago,Mallory C.,"Came here with a small group on Monday night - it was gorgeous outside and they have a patio, so thought we'd try it out. Unfortunately there wasn't space left on the patio but they had the doors opened (garage-style doors) so we were still able to enjoy it to some degree.

One of the best things about this place? Half price food on Mondays. Meaning all food. Incredible!

I got the burger and we got frites and brussel sprouts for the table. I was skeptical of the burger going in because it looks like a lot of bread for not-as-much burger, but the bread is super soft and squishes down so it actually ends up being pretty good proportions. The frites were fresh and served with garlic aioli. The brussel sprouts, however were a huge disappointment. I'm glad we got one for the table rather than getting one for myself. They were super bitter and a little mushy (I like crispy sprouts) and the apples were sliced rather than little chunks evenly spread through the dish (which would have helped offset the bitterness IMO).

The biggest complaint I have was that the music was incredibly loud. Loud enough that I struggled to hear the people at my table talking. If it'd been later or a Friday/Saturday I would have understood but it was 7pm on a Monday.

All in all, I'd go back. Just wouldn't get the brussel sprouts."
g-and-o-chicago,Eowyn K.,"G & O was suggested for brunch when we were looking for a place without a wait. The bar and patio had a good design and a smart use of space for a patio on a triangle corner. Garage style doors open the interior of the bar to the fenced in patio. The atmosphere was relaxed and the service was friendly. Drinks were brought quickly and the food order took an average amount of time. The Bloodies Mary's were standard at a reasonable price, especially for Chicago, for $5 (Mimosas are also $5). 

The brunch menu has a good mix and includes some reasonably healthy options. I had the smoked salmon potato pancakes with a side of bacon. The potato pancakes were quite small and a bit overpowered by the toppings of smoked salmon, placed eggs and dill creme fraiche. The dish was still good, the eggs were poached correctly and went well with the salmon and dill. The bacon was particularly good, thick cut cooked perfectly. The portions were reasonable and everyone at my table finished their plate."
g-and-o-chicago,Marissa F.,"My friends and I came here for brunch after some good old fashioned protesting, so we were hungry and ready to drink away the weight of oppression. Though it was a Saturday, there were open tables and so we sat and ordered drinks (they had special mimosas for $5 which my friends took advantage of immediately). 

We got the house brioche French toast and fried chicken and waffles. The chicken was good, not the best fried chicken I've ever had, but oh god the waffle was delicious. I normally go savory for brunch because, hello this is not dessert, but this waffle made me really rethink my usual strategy. It was dense, sweet, and perfect with the gravy. The French toast was huge and pretty good as well. 

Basically the fried chicken and waffle compensated for the political discouragement we were feeling, or maybe it was the mimosas? Either way, great brunch choice fur shure."
g-and-o-chicago,Nichole X.,"Another surprise this week! I would say definitely order their dessert - Sticky Bun!!! Super warm, fresh and delicious :p 

Lots of place were closed for Memorial Day, so we were kinda worried for dinner. Since we were out in the area, we decided to try G&O because of the good review :) Will come back next time we are in this area."
g-and-o-chicago,Clara S.,"This spot was pretty crowded for brunch on this Sunday, so we got ourselves a spot at the bar. The bartender was friendly and entertaining, though so we didn't mind. I loved the $5 mimosas and bloodys deal as well. 

I ordered the smoked salmon Benedict, which wasn't amazing. The dish was pretty tasty, but nothing special. I also tried my friend's veggie hash, which wasn't so flavorful either. It looked a lot better than it tasted. The potatoes though were probably the best part of the meal.

Overall, glad I finally tried this place (I had bookmarked it for the mimosa and bloody deals), but not my type of brunch spot."
g-and-o-chicago,Shannon N.,"Have to say, I'm not a fan. Food here is totally overpriced: tiny, and less than stellar quality. I don't want a puny gyro with no sides; I want a big manly gyro with some fries. I don't want sad squishy undercooked cinnamon rolls swimming in butter; I want fluffy cinnamon rolls that have been baked in an oven. Furthermore, I don't necessarily want to hear all of Boss' Life and Ego Trippin' blaring back-to-back.

As Snoop Dogg would say, ""Whatever it is you do you have to master your craft."" Get your brunch game together, G&O."
g-and-o-chicago,Olivia M.,"All I have to say is I went here on Monday for their 1/2 priced food deal and ended up with the most violent food poisoning I've ever had. I don't want to be too graphic, but I ended up projectile vomiting at my friend's place shortly after leaving the restaurant and had to miss a day of work. It took my stomach several days to fully recover."
g-and-o-chicago,Joanna G.,"Visiting family over Thanksgiving and stumbled on this gem. Saturday and Sunday = $5 mimosas and bloodies!! We walked in and 20 second later had water and a seat. The service was phenomenal and the bloodies were amazing . We ordered the fries which were huge and also only $5. 

Absolutely love this place and the ambiance. We'll definitely be back. Thank you thank you!!"
g-and-o-chicago,Ally F.,"The vibe in the place is really cool. A few friends and I tried it out on a Sunday night and although it's a cozy place, it was really busy. The music was spot on for a fun Sunday night (spice girls, hip hop, etc). The cocktails were on special for $7 and all the food we ordered was really good. Highly recommend the Cauliflower Tikka Masala!"
g-and-o-chicago,Dontina W.,"I've been here a lot for their great specials on weekday nights, it's always a good vibe and their outdoor patio is awesome. However, my favorite experience has been coming in for brunch on a rainy day. Their brunch is AMAZING. I got the avocado toast with egg and my boyfriend got the thick french toast with whiskey infused bacon. We both sat at the bar with bloodies and the bartender was extremely cool. Great experience, we'll be back!"
g-and-o-chicago,Kelsey S.,"My gym buddies and I came here for brunch on Saturday and stayed for 4 hours.  The food is FANTASTIC - I live and die by the chicken & waffles - and the service is even better.  Shout out to the GM, Kris, who made us feel totally at home, memorized all our names, made great recommendations, and kept us laughing.  I can't wait to come back!"
g-and-o-chicago,Jenna C.,"Met a friend here for brunch on a Sunday around 10:30. Loved the outside - I guess it used to be an old Gas Station? Totally transformed. And surprisingly, it wasn't busy at all when I walked in. Seemed to be a locals joint actually (there were a mix of families, friends, etc.) and the servers were pretty chill and cool too. 
I started with an orange juice without looking at the menu and was surprised to find at the end of the meal that it cost me $6. Lol that's more than the $5 all day mimosas they were serving - and that has champagne in it! Oh well, it was fresh squeezed and delicious so no other complaints other than the price. My food was also delicious - I got the G & O toast and it rocked my tastebud world. My friend got the breakfast sandwich and also said it was amazingly good. Definitely a good amount of interesting options to choose from on the menu. 
Our server was friendly and helpful, but (disclaimer: this is a personal preference) I felt he was a little overly attentive. A couple times I found myself just about to spill something personal to my friend and he was right there asking if he could take my plate or filling our water glasses. Kind of comical in a way actually. But I would totally come back for brunch and will definitely be stopping by to try dinner and cocktails sometime. Overall great experience"
g-and-o-chicago,Brian B.,"Stopped here for a drink after brunch and had a great time.  The Bloody Mary with horseradish vodka was out of this world. Those and the mimosas are also only $5, so I'll be back here whenever I'm the neighborhood.  The food looks amazing too."
podhalanka-chicago,Andrea A.,"This was one of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant in a long time. I pass this place all the time and never thought about checking it out. Only went because my friend was in town visiting and wanted pierogis. When we walked in, Greg, our server greeted us and we went to sit at the bar. 

He asked have we ever been and we haven't so he said oh let me surprise you. Omg we had a feast. Soup (the cabbage soup and a creamy soup with sausage)and bread for starters, then the potato pancakes, pierogis (3 different kinds), stuffed cabbage, and cheese blintzes and homemade juice. 

Definitely will return. Oh it's cash only btw."
podhalanka-chicago,Mark G.,"I'll post my gripe first, the deceptive ordering is flat out wrong and there shouldn't be several reviews sharing the same negative story. You are greeted by a smooth talking male employee who has a very, very strong tactic of ordering for you and making it seem like your getting a sampler of the best dishes, in reality you get full sized portions that may be too much food for some.  It's the way he goes about it that's the problem, he doesn't give you a chance to order, question, and comes on very strong and doesn't fully explain what the cost, size, or what you're getting into. What you will be getting by letting him order is overpriced juice, FULL plates of food that are not samplers in the least bit, and most likely more than you can eat or wanted.

Hold your ground and order what you want, don't allow him to order for you whatsoever or don't go here at all if they keep doing this. 

Read several of the reviews below before you decide to come here, others have felt cheated. I personally felt a bit swindled by what was presented followed by the full portions coming out. We had more than we would have ordered with some to take home, it wasn't a huge deal at the moment and I don't think the majority of people would have ordered this amount of food and that's the main problem. The more I thought about this and the finally read other stores is why I decided to give 1 Star.

The food is great, it's some of the best that I've had. It was fresh, of very good quality, and had a lot of flavor. It's just the tactics the one server used and reading others negative reviews that have really turned me off from coming back again. I would suggest they have a sampler plate if they really want the customers to experience several items and sell it in a ethical way like other restaurants do."
podhalanka-chicago,Kevin B.,"When people say ""Old Chicago"" this is what they are referring to! If you are in Chicago and looking for Polish food, make sure you check this off your bucket list! 

Old school and proud of it, homemade everything!"
podhalanka-chicago,Ryen B.,"Yelp reviewers describe this place well. Two elderly women who sweetly up-sell more food than you'll need. Menu photos attached, but not all items are available everyday. We tried a bunch of dishes, none that wowed us. 
- Pierogies- come filled with meat, cabbage, or potato and cheese. We tried all three. All very heavy, but not something I'd order again
- Potato pancakes come 3 two an order with apple sauce and sour cream. They needed a bit more flavor (onion, garlic, salt) and were just plain fried potato.
- Stuffed cabbage- large rolls filled with meat. Not my thing, but others said they were ok
- Soup- we tried tomato and rice (had an off taste), cabbage (nah), and the picked rice (this was 
one creamy and tasted ok)
- No cold sauerkraut, but they had it hot- not my thing
- Salads- tomatoes and cukes- pass. pickled beets- just ok.

Glad we tried a local place, but wouldn't return."
podhalanka-chicago,Will B.,"Such a great place. So happy it's still around and continues to serve great Polish food. A true mom and pop Polish restaurant, at least how Id imagine one to be."
podhalanka-chicago,Julie O.,"This is a place I always keep on coming back every time I want a hot soup and a hearty meal on a cold day. First time I went, we were greeted by an older man and we literally had a feast. From then on, I have just stuck to the cabbage soup (so frickin good!), and either the stuffed cabbage, potato pancakes or just a polish sausage with their homemade juice. I love the two old ladies that run the kitchen. Everything just hits the spot. This isn't the kind of place you are coming to get ""ambiance"" or anything, sometimes you just want polish grandmas cooking you really good food."
podhalanka-chicago,Jennifer S.,"We were amused to see the negative reviews, and that prompted us to write one of our own.  It's great.  REALLY great.  The guy (owner?) at the lunch counter does suggest what he thinks is his best.  The guy knows his food.  That is not ""up-selling.""  We knew we wanted an assortment since we can't find authentic Polish food where we live.  We also knew we couldn't eat all of the dishes he suggested.  SO we edited what he suggested, and in addition to what we already knew we wanted, got two other things we didn't know about and would not have had the pleasure of experienced without his help.   
As far as cleanliness, suck it up, Buttercup. You want authentic?  You have to be a little less type A.  Otherwise, go to McDonalds."
podhalanka-chicago,Roberta C.,"You couldn't get more authentic unless you went to Poland. Three Polish grammas were working when we came by for dinner on Sunday night. We got white borscht with sausage and it was a huge hit, even with the 2 year old; tasty potato and cheese pierogis; cucumber salad; and a most-filling stuffed pork. We were looking for a hole in the wall, super-authentic, family style, Polish diner and we found it."
podhalanka-chicago,Emily H.,"Family style polish restaurant, the owners are all very nice and gives out a family feeling.

Really liked the beef tripe soup, it is very tasty and they are very generous with the amount of beef tripe too.

The house salad is very good and healthy, with picked cabbage and shredded beets and the common salad ingredients like cucumber, lettuce and tomato.

The beef goulash entr√©e is very good and hearty."
podhalanka-chicago,Carrie B.,"I used to live in Chicago (10 years ago) and would go here with my friends all the time. The food is good - I'll give them that. Last weekend I was back in town and had a hankering for some Polish food. In the past I'd always had an older woman wait on me, and she was lovely and friendly. This time I had a waiter who said he had worked there for 33 years, but I'd never had him wait on me before. He brought us menus, but what was the point because he then totally overrode our menu ordering and said he would bring us house specialties and soups, and pierogie selections, etc. etc. We really didn't have an opportunity to say no....then came the food. Lots of it. Granted, it was delicious and we had leftovers but I sure as hell wasn't planning to spend $80 on a dinner with NO ALCOHOL. Cash only. Be warned. I'm pissed off, and would like to warn others to look out for this scamming waiter."
podhalanka-chicago,Sarah B.,This place is pretty hilarious. You feel like you're in your polish grandmas kitchen. It's kinda a scam. They give you the menu and then the waiter does this whole bit about giving you his professional opinion and you get this special order -- well everyone's getting that special order. The food is very good but you end up getting a lot more than you would probably normally order and it's not cheap. If you want an authentic polish experience it's worth it.
podhalanka-chicago,K J.,"Familial type of restaurant welcoming to all ethnic groups!
Place opened in 1986 and is serving traditional Polish food!"
podhalanka-chicago,Emily S.,"The kindness and warmth exhibited by the owners are the reason I return. This place is a total gem (with the best soups I have EVER EATEN) and no matter how far I travel, I will always be back!"
podhalanka-chicago,Chris G.,"Phenomenal Polish food...just nothing like this in Indianapolis.  And you know you are in the right Polish place when you walk in and can't understand a word from the TV broadcast playing and everyone has accents so thick you need to squint.

The place oozes eclectic...it appears to be a former tavern, based on the high exterior windows, the long bar turned into a dining area, and the Old Style (beer) lights they never bothered to take down.

The one constant with Polish places I have eaten at seems to be knickknacks scattered about, a picture of Pope John Paul II, etc.  Here it is very similar with old stuff gathering dust on the back wall, a greeting card carousel (?!?) that doesn't look like it has seen any business in 20 years, and a white-yellowing couch presumably from a college dorm that has seen it's share of...yeah... Anyways...

We sat down and started with the soup...my brother had a white borscht and I had a split pea.  Rye bread on the side.  Great starter and it was big enough where you could just have THAT and the bread and be done.  But as other reviews have mentioned, the food just keeps a comin'...

Next up was a salad...both were served with what tasted like a homemade creamy dressing and a sour relish I was unfamiliar with.  Really good.  And the food keeps coming...

Next was a giant pork cutlet for me, boiled beef for my brother.  Both served with a massive heap of potatoes.  This was some real comfort food...the pork cutlet was fried perfectly. So good...and we aren't done yet...

Last was an order of blintzes, which were sort of a crepe served with a sour cream cheese'ish filling.  Applesauce and sour cream on the side.  We were so full by this point but what the hell.

However many 1000s of calories later (and probably an hour and a half of time) we were done.  Think we ended up around $50 for both of us but what the hell...not somewhere I would get to often since I was visiting.  The old folks running the place were very nice and gracious as well.

Just a great experience."
podhalanka-chicago,Ned S.,"The place for pirogies, latkes and soups!  You will not be disappointed!  It is worth the wait.

CASH ONLY!"
podhalanka-chicago,Kira G.,"Blown away. It was just the lovely older couple here and they made us such authentically delicious food which took our taste buds on a trip! I love how proud they are of their cooking, and rightfully so.
Two of us ordered one of the big meals that includes soup and salad for $20 and shared one of the smaller meals to accompany. So we ended up with a grand 3-course meal for two and paid about $30! 
Highly recommended!!! Don't miss this gem of true Chicago history."
podhalanka-chicago,Mary H.,"Very good authentic food.  Surprised to read some of the negative reviews on here about being upsold--as it didn't happen to us (but then again we were eating with a local Polish speaking priest so perhaps that is why charges were normal and the juice was free) lol
Would recommend it.  The zurek was spot on how it was in Poland when I recently visited.  The Pierogi delicious!"
podhalanka-chicago,Ben C.,"I would give this a two because the older woman cooking the food worked hard and is probably oblivious to whatever manipulative BS her coworker is up to, but I simply cannot.

To be frank, this place is a total SCAM! I have never felt so tricked and used as a customer in a public restaurant, or any facility for that matter. The waiter makes it sound like he's bringing you some ""on the house"" juice and starters and then takes your menus away before you can even order. HE tells you what he's bringing you and before you know it a smorgasbord of polish food you DID NOT ask for appears on your table. You start to wonder what the hell is happening, but your gut instinct gets overridden with the thought that ""people are inherently good and that everything will be okay."" Listen to your gut because you will then get handed a bill for 150+ dollars for the food you had no say in. Also he makes it clear its ""Cash Only"" despite the credit card reader clearly behind the cash register. 

If you dare to venture in here, good luck. Make sure you have a lot of cash on you."
podhalanka-chicago,Raktima D.,"Amazing food. The soup was out of the world ! Fish fry really nice , didn't feel like it was fried deep. The stuffed pork was really tasty . Must try out. 
But remember this is a CASH ONLY place."
podhalanka-chicago,Sean M.,"Food is great.  But the owner can be pushy and overbearing on how, what and how much to order.  

Read the menu.  And do t miss out on the stuffed cabbage and the cheese perogies."
cafe-central-chicago,Shay B.,"It's was such an awesome mistake!! I was in the area for a meeting and decided to walk around with my sister to find a place to eat. We were on our way to the place across the street, when I decided to wonder into this restaurant! Great place, great service and amazing prices with great tasting food. Super simple, tasty food and great atmosphere. I WILL be back! Fell in love with this place. Such an amazing gem in the mist of all that gentrification."
cafe-central-chicago,Ashley M.,"I'm no expert on Puerto Rican food, but I can tell you that everything I had here was awesome. Boyfriend had a roast pork jibarito and I got the mixtas plate which comes with rice, beans, potato, and your choice of meat. I chose chicken which was fall off the bone, melt in your mouth delicious. Server was kind, attentive and made me a mean cappuccino. Definitely a spot to check out."
cafe-central-chicago,Stephanie L.,"This has been on my list for awhile.  I love the mom & pop places with the authentic food.  And cafe central did not disappoint!

When we walked in, I instantly felt like I was transported back in time and it definitely had a Puerto Rico flair going on.  They still have a pay phone!!!  Love.

The staff was EXCELLENT.  Recommending certain dishes, splitting portions, waiting on us but not hovering...or really was great.  

It's a BYOB so bring all your boozy drinks with you...and they have chocolate milk!!!  Love it.

The food was great and fast.  I haven't had mofongo since I was in PR.  Tasted just like it.  The pork jibarito was perfect.  We also tried:
steak jibarito also good, but pork was just a tad better.   
fried porkchops, damn good!  I know it's not healthy, but it was worth it.  The seasonings and flavor in the fried crust...yum!
empanada, it was also good, but probably my least fav dish just because it was so plain.  A dipping sauce would've been good.

I'll definitely be back!"
cafe-central-chicago,Adela G.,Nice cozy place and friendly prices are reasonable love their food  I had a carry out order but we will return for in house review I will keep you posted!!!
cafe-central-chicago,Baby C.,"Had dinner with my bff, the place small and basic, if you love comida puertorique√±o you'll enjoy here, the waitresses are very kind, attentive and sociable. We had jibaritos de bistec y de vegetariano con arroz y gandules - mojo de ajo is a must. This had been here for a long time and is well worth it! Always a delight"
cafe-central-chicago,Jason T.,"They are doing it up in here. Rican feel. Rican art and photos. Rican fare. All that's missing is the finesse. It doesn't look run down, it's just bland looking. I came as Google kept putting CC at the top of their Puerto-Rican cuisine list. And as a Rican from NYC, it was my duty. And I'm always down for arroz con gandules. Sat myself at the corner counter. Sheer friendly lady spoke in Spanish and asked what I would like. Well, a Passion fruit juice, an alcapurria, a pastelillo, a Jibarito sandwich with pernil and a side of arroz con gandules. First off, I had to order another juice because I took that 1st bottle down. And it was Goya. Not too sweet or thick or tart. Yum. The alcapurria, a taro root fritter stuffed with seasoned ground beef, was on deck and ready for me. This fritter is best when piping hot and it was room temperature. Maybe lower because the ac was pumping. I also got the pastelillo or empanada. Filled probably with that same beef filling, it's crimped closed and fried. It too was about room temperature, at least they should be under a heating lamp. Maybe. I was scared to have the Jibarito in the first place. I've never had it. I don't know about using plantain in lieu of bread. It was going to be my first time. It came with the works and I am usually anti-the works. I chose the pernil, or roasted pork and it comes with mayo, American cheese, and l and t. I just wanted the lettuce and the cheese. And that's rare for me to have American cheese on my pernil. Yuck. But....*shrugs*. And I should have just got it with just pork because the lettuce was hot and yuck with the cheese. That ain't the Rican fare I know. And the plantain couldn't hold up to those juices that were penetrating into it. Leaving me with a soggy mess of delicious, seasoned pork. After one bite I started using my fork. The rice too was on that steam table that the frituras were in. So aside from being enjoyable, I was screaming for a microwave inside. And my pastelillo's filling was a little sour. Maybe too much vinegar. I did get full pretty quickly and got a bill for just under $20. I had experienced and felt a lot since I sat down here. Nothing bad. Just little points that can be fine tuned. Service is attentive."
cafe-central-chicago,Kelly C.,Favorite spot for Jibaritos! Lecho(Pork) and Shrimp are my to go sandwiches. Amazing spicy green salsa served with French bread
cafe-central-chicago,Ameer S.,"Low key Puerto Rican restaurant with delicious food. I have yet to try their most famous dishes, but they can definitely expect my continued business. Glad it's also BYOB"
cafe-central-chicago,Chuck A.,"One of my favorite unheralded spots in the city. Super good. If you simply love great food, esp. if you're gluten free/celiac, or just like to pretend you need to be gluten free because it makes you feel better about your life choices or whatever (??) you can't go wrong with a Jibarito. Plantains as the 'bread', around whatever protein you choose...man. I ate here for the first time like 2 months ago and I've been back once or twice a week every week since. It's the kind of texture and food you just can't get enough of or stop thinking about. Tip: Sit at the bar. The waitresses are super friendly and it's just a great experience."
cafe-central-chicago,Ashley S.,"This place is super cleaned !!! Amazing sandwich and sweet plantains are so good!! Reasonable price , highly recommend for brunch on weekend."
cafe-central-chicago,Cely R.,"Puerto Rican food
Frituras & more
I been there 3 times is ok
Gandules rice
Jibaritos
Mofongo
Cafe con leche
Huge porcions to share
My waitress  was nice and faster"
cafe-central-chicago,Taffany H.,"Super home cooked feel at this Puerto Rican place. I found Cafe Central via Yelp, of course, after sifting through a whole bunch of puerto rican places in Chicago to try out the Jibarito. And it was worth the trek. From it's nostalgic old time diner feel to very friendly staff, Cafe Central already felt like it was too good to be true. But it is that good!
We were greeted by a friendly wait staff who proceeded to make recommendation for a few items to try out including the beef stew, the steak jibaritos, the pork chop that comes with scrumptious yellow rice, and to top it all off, the fresh mushed garlic. If you have stomach big enough for one sandwich when you get here, I'd recommend coming multiple times. And at least for your first time there, the steak Jibaritos is a must eat. Tender, juicy, perfectly cooked piece of stake, sandwiched in between a piece of American cheese, (yes, I thought I would never eat American cheese,) and two pieces and flattened green plantains standing in for bread, eat this with the garlic mush the waitress lady gives you and there you have it, this is one of the best kept low carb sandwich all the bros and SF still have yet to Columbus. 
This one is on my Chicago must list for sure."
cafe-central-chicago,Jose A.,"We thought we try a new place out for Puerto Rican food walked in and there heater is not working it is freezing in here. We didn't even get offered something warm to drink oh, a nice cup of warm coffee would have been nice while waiting for our food. My food was cold within 10 minutes of receiving it. Very Disappointed."
cafe-central-chicago,Paul I.,"Good simple restaurant. My friend had a ""mixta"". A puertorrican dish of rice and beans and a protein, in this case pork. His dish was actually really good. My other friend ordered the octopus in a tomatoe garlic and capers sauce. Pretty decent. I had the asopao de pollo with tostones. Just ok. Too watery. Asopao is a more dense, full of flavor dish. This was mediocre. May try them again, but not for the asopao."
cafe-central-chicago,Eric M.,It's not hard to find Puerto Rican food in Chicago and not every place cuts it. Central certainly has the goods. They have all the standards but they do it all impeccably. Needs a bit of an update to make it feel more homey.
cafe-central-chicago,Mike N.,The best kept culinary secret in Chicago. I've been eating here for 21 years. Same quality. Some of the same waitress. Best food.
cafe-central-chicago,Vickie W.,"THIS PLACE IS FANTASTIC! Had a friend come visit from out of town and wanted to explore the Puerto Rican scene. We decided to go to Cafe Central and so glad we did! First of all, the staff were so kind and accommodating - we came fifteen minutes before closing and asked for jibaritos. Even though they totally could have turned us down since their kitchen was closing down, they made the food for us. We got the pork and the steak jibaritos and AHHH IT WAS AMAZING! The soft fried plantains as the ""bread"" of the sandwich, the beautifully melted cheese laying on the perfectly cooked meat, the tomato and pickle added to give some balance to the richness of the flavors.... it was divine. Plus, it's a family owned restaurant, which is so precious, and you have a feel of being in the home go a friend! Loved this place and can't wait to try more of their menu!"
cafe-central-chicago,Chewy C.,I've worked near this place for the past 5yrs and finally walked in. 1st I have to say I love this place. It reminds me of the old school Puerto Rican restaurants you saw on division or armitage in the 80s. The food is good and the atmosphere is great. The lunch counter is definitely a plus.
cafe-central-chicago,Jonathan C.,There's not much to say. It's a no frills spot where the food is downright amazing. Plus you get really big portions for really low prices.
cafe-central-chicago,Bryan C.,"Hands down, one of the best places I have been to for food of this type! Anything pork is off of the hook and all of the stews they have are absolutely sublime. This has become on of my favorites. The staff is always friendly and the orders are always correct. Be sure not to miss the side of fried plantains!!!"
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Matt M.,"Its falafel meets chipotle. 

The staff is great, the service is quick, the place is clean. All of this is 5 star. 

The food is just average. They give you a ton of hummus a small amount of falafel, and a decent amount of rice. I'm not sure how fresh the falafel is. I've certainly had better but it was convenient and affordable.

Parking in this lot is a nightmare. Good luck."
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Leo K.,"The good news was it was edible....

I had the falafel plate with tabbouleh and hummus. It would have been okay if the place was called mediterranean food by people who have never tried mediterranean food. The falafel was squishy (never thought id say that). The tabbouleh tasted like there was cucumber in it but i couldn't find the cucumber. The hummus was acceptable but i cant see how you could mess up hummus. The presentation wasn't the worst. I hope they fix this because we really need clean affordable mediterranean food."
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Leah R.,"I've been a huge fan ever since I found this place in a sketchy food court off Clark & Lake. The food court has since closed and I am so happy to have found they have branched out.

The chicken shawarma plate with hummas, mediterranean salad and couscous is my yum and so delicious! They aren't cheap with the ingredients so I always feel that I get my moneys worth. 

The nice thing is you can either get a pre-made pita sandwich if you already know what you like.  Or you can make a plate which allows you to pick your protein and sides. This is a great option for people who aren't sure what they might like so they can try a few things to find out. 

They also have this really cool water dispenser which lets you choose flat or fizzy. Or you can choose flavored."
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Jess J.,"I've been to plenty of Mediterranean ""fast food"" restaurants in the city, and I have decided that this one is my favorite so far! 
I had a steak kabob pita the first time I went here and it was honestly phenomenal!
The second time I had the chicken shawarma plate with baba ghanouj, Mediterranean salad and couscous-- so delicious! Everything is so fresh and unique in flavor and options! Very healthy too!
The way this place works is you can either get a pre-made pita sandwich; or you can make a plate which allows you to mix and match, and in my opinion, gives you way more bang for your buck! 
Highly recommend the hummus and baba ghanouj- for a home stash obviously! You won't regret it!"
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,chandu r.,"Love the yummy  food! Hot and fresh!!! Couldn't ask for more.

Persian yoghurt and chicken kabab were yummy"
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Stacy P.,"It was sort of mid day, and I needed something more substantial than just a snack but not really ready for dinner either.  It sort of reminds me of a Mediterranean Panera Bread.  The staff was pleasant, the cashier asked me how my day was going, and we made small talk about the weather. There was no line.  It's definitely a fast casual restaurant.  You have your choices of hummus, baba ganoush, or a yogurt cucumber sauce.  I asked to try the hummus (I'm very picky about my hummus).  It was okay, but not like WOW (try Tarboush, one of my faves).  Nbd.  Then you pick your type of salad, I chose the tabouli.  My starch, farro.  My protein, Chicken Shawarma.  The other chicken options looked D R Y.  

It has plenty of seating, either against a long booth with tables and a chair on the opposite side, or a communal table when you walk in.  Some of the tables still had schmutz on them though, and some napkins balled up on the floor.  Needs a little clean up.  They have what appears to be a humorous (well, not in my mind, but I get where they're going with it) wall of how the establishment came to be and their ingredients.  Ha funny.  Kind of.  No not really.  TV's are vertical instead of horizontal... nothing was on the screens though.  They also have one of those Coke machines with the new technology where you can have your Coke with a hundred different options (cherry, vanilla, etc.).  I had water.  Free water, and they are earth friendly with recyclable cups, napkins, etc.  

FOOD:  The farro was mild and slightly sweet, just the right amount of chew. There was an ample amount of chicken (brownie points +), but the temperature was just lukewarm (brownie points - ).  Yogurt sauce is quite garlicky, say HAAAAAAA.  lol  But I like garlic, so....  Tabouli salad seems more American, less Mediterranean.  Chopped size veggies, not small dice.  Not enough parsley or lemon either.  Hey, but for $10!  This meal served its purpose, and there was plenty more chicken than anticipated.  Plus, the parking lot has 30 minutes of free parking.  So, score!"
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Nikita D.,"OMG has been our favorite Mediterranean restaurant for the last 5 years or so but over the past few months their management changed and things haven't been the same! They are extremely inconsistent and that makes us really sad. Today we ordered the falafel sandwich, chicken kabob sandwich and both of these were super dry. It was because they put the spreads sparingly only on one side and we literally had to pour tahini on it to make it edible! We wish the old staff comes back...they were really good!!"
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Jessica K.,"What a delicious meal!! My husband and I both ordered the ""OMG"" plate, and both absolutely loved it! We order through Postmates and by the time it got to us, the Protein was still flavorful and juicy. Mediterranean salad was my favorite! 
Will definitely be back soon"
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Kemi D.,"Food is okay. Steak shawarma was particularly tough. Placed an online takeout order and had items missing (highlighted). I called the restaurant and Logan informed me that the manager was not in at the moment and took my email and number. No reassurance of when I will hear from them or when the manager will be back in. 

Plus, parking lot is shared with a strip of other businesses (Starbucks, NYC Bagel, Kay Jewelers, etc) and it is horrendous."
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Desma X.,"I usually love Olive - in fact it is probably my favorite Mediterranean places in the city and I've been several times. The spicy chicken kabob is my favorite and I recently tried the new cous cous and baba ganoush which were amazing. However, the most recent time I went in to Olive, the chicken kabob was WAY undercooked. The inside was almost completely raw, as can be seen in my picture. The restaurant gave me a new plate free of charge, but who knows if anyone else had contaminated food. Publishing this more as a PSA than anything to double check your meat here, especially if it is chicken!

Also, after a previous time eating here, my boyfriend and I were sick for the next few days. I was skeptical at the time that we may have gotten bad food...after seeing the raw chicken this time, I'm pretty confident that's the case."
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Amy W.,"I ordered catering service for a training meeting, and this place is popular with my employeed. I ordered chicken and steak with rice hummus pita and salad. I broke three forks trying to cut the steak it was so tough and fatty. The catering bill was over 900.00 for 40 people which is quite steep compared to other catering services. Overall it was okay, just be prepared for your total!"
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Linda N.,I love eating here . It's a bit pricey but worth it . The steak and chicken is moist and juicy . I think this place is healthy . You can taste the freshness .
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Michael S.,"Olive Mediterranean Grill is basically the Mediterranean version of Chipotle. You have your choice of a pita or a plate. I decided on a chicken shawarma pita. It was stuffed with tomato cucumber salad, garlic sauce, and chicken shawarma. If you are looking for a fast, affordable Mediterranean meal this place is for you."
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Anthony H.,"Second time here and i love it! Great tasting food a marvelous selection and amazing customer service on both days!! If in the area and looking for a speedy, authentic and delicious yet healthy meal this is the place to be"
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Steve K.,I usually stop by this place on my way back to the suburbs. The young man preparing my plates made sure to measure each scoop as if there was none left for the next customer. very disappointing
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Holly S.,"Great restaurant, the food is fabulous  and I'm definitely going back again! Very friendly and welcoming owner as well!!"
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Madge W.,It stinks! The food is extremely salty. The couscous is waterlogged to the point of being unidentifiable. Wouldn't eat here again if it was free!
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Tiffany H.,This is a small location in a shopping center off north. The staff and friendly and attentive. They make suggestions based on your preferences and popularity. Typically clean when I come. They offer 30 minute parking in their lot. Pay attention to your time while I was there in two different times I noticed they towed someone's car. They are reasonably priced and pretty healthy. I think the food offerings are delicious. I will return and recommend.
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Howard L.,"I've never been to this establishment but me and my girlfriend we're visiting the city and she insisted that we come in and try it out. I walked in, absolutely no problems, I really enjoyed what they had on their menu. As I was looking through the menu, I heard a bunch of yelling from the employees and it just grew exponentially worse. My server came up to me and told me that it's normal from of that employee, who's name I found out from our server is an employee name Abigail.

I ordered my food and every now and then, we'd glance over there and we see her either belittling the staff and just treating the staff with the up-most disrespect it utterly sickened me. Me and my girlfriend requested our food to be taken to go upon arrival just because we we're disgusted what we saw because of Abigail and it's the reason now we'll never come back and recommend dining at this place. The food was good, not the experience. Never coming back."
olive-mediterranean-grill-chicago-3,Michael C.,"Good place to stop by if you just need a quick lunch and are looking for your quick fix of Mediterranean food. I always get the platter with their steak shawarma or chicken shawarma. Their steak kabobs are also quite delicious. The place is clean, theres a parking lot, and staff are always friendly. Wouldn't exactly go out of my way to come here just to eat, but always a great option when im in the area!"
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Leah B.,"The burger was very good. Well cooked, and generous toppings. Plus a pretzel bun is always yum.  The sweet potato fries were amazing. Perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside

Downside was that the music was rather loud."
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Brandon J.,"This place had one of the most savory burgers I have ever tasted. The service was extremely quick, and I was very satisfied with my overall experience. 

Me and my girlfriend just came from the shedd aquarium and we were both craving burgers, since this was the closest place to us we decided to stop here. The atmosphere of the place was very welcoming it was not too crowded but there was still people there to make us feel at ease. Our service was really quick, we managed to put in our order 15 minutes after arriving, I'm guessing because it wasn't busy but there was always more than enough people walking around making sure we were taken care of. The wait time or our food was pretty average too, it was not super quick but it wasn't so long to where you would start asking ""where's my food?"" It was around 20 minutes. 

As for the food, my burger was amazing! I ordered the ""Build Your Own Burger"". I got a well done burger with bacon, lettuce, and tomato. With a side of fries and barbecue sauce not only for my burger but for my fries too. The burger was extremely well made and was very savory. You would expect a well done burger to taste kind of burnt but that was not the case at all. The fries were well seasoned but was still missing something. I felt that I had to constantly dip my fries in barbecue sauce to stop it from tasting like cardboard. As for the portion size my burger was was not huge but was still more than what I was used too. The fries came in a pretty small amount but with a burger of their size you wouldn't need all the fries anyway.

This was the first time I finished a burger of this size in one sitting! Everything was made perfectly, service and atmosphere was very welcoming and overall I had a good time there! I just wish the fries were made a bit better but its just something small. The prices were pretty reasonable to the amount and quality you receive, its not super cheap but not pricey either. I recommend this place to anybody looking for nice burger bar to eat at, trust me you wont regret it!"
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Chris M.,"If you're a meat lover, you'll love the burgers here, which are all stacked with multiple varieties of meat. Included on the menu are bison, cow, and pig taking various forms. I ordered the Barbacoa Stacker and I can't argue that it was a solid burger but I just felt overwhelmed with the amount of meat on it. Like I said, if you're a fan of copious amounts of meat, Burger Bar is for you.

Great service; our waitress was super friendly and food came out at a reasonable speed. Fun atmosphere; felt like a cozy, upscale sports bar. Excellent location; it's right next to the North and Clybourn red line stop. Extra points for having parmesan truffle fries.

3/5 for the burger but everything else brings Burger Bar up to a 4 in my books."
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Jen B.,"I am so impressed! We came over here after a two hour fiasco at the Apple Store, and I was hangry. They fed us well, and my mood improved before our long drive back to Bloomington!

It was about 2 pm and we hadn't eaten all day, so we began with the queso-guac-chips and the fried pickles. My wife really loved the queso and the seasoned chips. I liked the freshness of the guac, but the chips and queso weren't really my thing. That's okay though, because the fried pickles were fantastic! It worked out really well for us, because I had the pickles and she had the queso, and we were both very happy. 

When it came time for burgers, she made her own with cheddar cheese and sweet potato tots and I ordered the Barbacoa Stacker with truffle fries.  Now, anyone who knows me, knows that I don't like messy food, but this burger just sounded too good! It was amazing! I honestly can't remember a burger that I've liked more. Yes, it was messy, but I cut it in half and ate over my tray, and I didn't make a mess of myself! The flavors worked so well together -- someone in the kitchen really knows what they're doing! The truffle fries were also excellent. Service was excellent as well -- from our waitress to a very friendly busser . 

We each packed up half our burgers and most of our fries & tots and we finished them for dinner back in Bloomington! 

If you are in the area, I highly recommend coming here, I don't see how you could be disappointed!"
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Leah S.,This was our first time here and we were underwhelmed. We got the bacon burger and it is super over priced but we figured it'd be worth it. It ended up being dry and overcooked. Maybe we would have liked it more if we built our own.
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,J.P. W.,"We really liked the vibe of this place. The hostess was a little scattered as we asked for a table three times (of which there were plenty) but she was hellbent on giving us a booth. When offered the booth I finally said, ""we need a table with chairs"".  She had a blank stare on her face so she didn't seem to be particularly engaged in her duties.

Our server was Carmen and she was an absolute delight. She shared a great deal of information without being overbearing. She made sure we were well taken care of and she made excellent recommendations. Her demeanor was friendly. Unlike the hostess, Carmen was completely engaged with our experience and it added to the overall positive experience.

The bacon cheeseburger (with all the extra trimmings included) was good without being overwhelming. I enjoyed my meal very much. The fried pickles were OK, I must have been expecting pickle chips as these were pickle flats. The breading was slightly over the top.

Overall a great experience and again, props to Carmen for being a quality server who seemed to genuinely want us to have a good experience."
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Ericka A.,"My Husband had been here a few years ago and loved it. He'd brought me leftovers and even those were good, so I was excited to try it fresh and I suggested we stop in for our Anniversary Lunch since we were in the city and not incredibly far away.

I was stoked to see they had Poutine on the menu and went all out, adding Smoked Pulled Pork and a Fried Egg. My Husband went equally hog wild, ordering the Bratwurst Corn Dogs. I got a VanderMill Hard Cider (Raspberry) on tap and this is what we called a ""Starter."" These items could have easily been their own meal, particularly the Poutine.

The Poutine was great but I'd skip the Corn Dogs next time. I was hoping for more flavor at that price point, but found that the mustard sauce served with it held most of it. To be honest, it is better than most Corn Dogs, but I wanted more well seasoned Bratwurst flavor and it just kinda seemed like a better version of a Hot Dog. The Poutine, on the other hand, is well worth $8, and even $11.50 with the add-ons, in my opinion.

I got the Wild Bill Burger after getting a recommendation from the Server. I don't want to say she was wrong, but I didn't completely see the appeal. The Tomato Chutney was really acidic and kind of drowned out the other flavors, the patty itself was perhaps a little too lean (Bison) to compete with the toppings, and the Pretzel Roll was a bit dry. It was a decent and big Burger, but I didn't feel it justified paying $16, even with the tasty Fries and Chipotle Aioli. I think I should have gone with the Lacquered Duck Stacker instead.

The Milkshake ended up being the highlight of the meal. We split a Chocolate Cherry Bomb (Shake of the Month) and they were nice enough to split it up into two smaller ball jars.

Parking in the area is not ideal, but they do have a small lot with valet next door."
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Diana C.,"Went to burger bar last night. I am gluten free so was pleased that the fries were gluten free and that they had gluten free bun options. The fries were delicious, but the burger/bun left a lot to be desired. To be fair, gluten free buns are subpar compared to regular, but there are many many good brands out there now a days that don't crumble at first sight, like the one at burger bar. In addition, my burger was very dry. Finally, the service was very slow-- our waitress was great but seemed to be overworked. Burgers are pricier than they should be!"
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Gretchen L.,Who doesn't love a good gourmet burger?!?! Being a gourmet burger fan but also being gluten free can be a struggle sometimes.. I found this place while purposely looking for gourmet burger places with a gluten free bun option. These burgers are amazing. I like how they have different meats on the burgers as well. The staff is also very considerate of food allergies and made sure I knew which items were dairy and gluten free!
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Lisa A.,"Pros:
- Ample seating
- Conveniently located near North/Clybourn Red Line stop and the surrounding shopping district
- Good draft selection

Cons:
- Burgers that are loaded with toppings, but lack depth of flavor

I visit the shopping area near North/Clybourn frequently, and Burger Bar has always been on my list of places to try. This neighborhood is lacking overall in restaurant selection, so Burger Bar is an obvious choice for anyone looking for a meal that is a step up from the usual fast casual options in the area. 

Their feature menu items are their ""Stackers"" burgers - which are burgers LOADED with all types of toppings from chorizo to house made Fritos. I tried the Barbados Stacker which features a chorizo-angus burger, Colby jack cheese, smoked pork barbacoa, roasted jalapeno aioli, avocado salsa + crispy house made fritos. Overall, the burger looks impressive and is served with your choice of fries, sweet potato fries, or a salad. They also have a variety of dipping sauces for your meal like chipotle aioli (which I tried, and it was delicious). 

The burger, however, fell flat in the flavor department. For having so many different toppings, the flavor is strictly beef and salt. It desperately needed the tang of a pickle or the sweetness of a BBQ sauce to balance out all that meat, salt, and grease. Overall, this is not the kind of burger I want to spend a ""cheat meal"" on. Kudos though for including the fries in the price and having a semi dry cider on draft."
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Levi W.,"Drink was stiff for the price. Burger has no business being almost $20. Ordered medium and it came out charcoal. Expressed this nicely to the waiter and showed him. Justified this because ""they are cooked on open flame."" I guess this is what you can expect every time. 

You can go to grange burger hall or au cheval and pay the same price for an entirely different league of food. I have no spite against the staff or the place itself so please believe me when I say you are better off getting 1-12 burgers at McDonalds and enjoying what you are eating."
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Christian M.,"I ordered 3 burgers for take out a little past noon on a Sunday.

I was quoted about 20-30 minutes (if i recall correctly) and received my food promptly after coming in.

I went to the bar to pay for and pick up my order and was immediately met by a very social and friendly employees.  The bartender started some small talk with me and I felt so welcomed even though it was my first time ever coming to this place.  I normally do not tip for take out orders, but the service and positive experience I received made it a no-brainer than I'd include a tip.

I ordered the following:
Hot & smokey with fresh cut fries
Firehouse with sweet potato fries
Chicken burger with sweet potato fries

Right away, you can tell (or at least it looks like) the fries are freshly cut, even for the sweet potato fries.  The sweet potato fries were delicious and had a great mix of crunch and softness.  The fresh cut fries were so good too and reminded me of Five Guys quality fries, which I really like.

The hot and smokey includes a bbq beef burger, smoked pulled pork, grilled hot link, tillamook cheddar, habanero bbq glaze, and a cucumber and onion slaw... and lord Jesus this was QUITE the combination.  Even the grilled hot link had a nice snap from the casing!  The burger was full of flavor and remained so moist!  The buns held up against the sauce and juices and was a perfect match.  The bbq sauce might cause a small mess, but that did not detract from how darn good this was!

The firehouse had a chipotle spiced burger, charred jalape√±o-scallion-chorizo relish, pepper jack, and guajillo aioli.  This resulted in a good kick, but I didn't find it to be very spicy.  People who want a really spicy burger should upgrade to the el diablo sauce for an extra dollar.  Anyways, this was another phenomenal burger!  Moist, flavorful, good kick and spices while not taking away from your ability to taste the meat and condiments!  This burger can get a tad messy, but it was well worth it!

Lastly, the chicken burger seemed to be the simplest of all I ordered since it only had arugula, chicken, and a tomato and pesto aioli, but they did not skimp on the volume of food.  There was a hearty portion of arugula and the chicken was pretty thick yet so moist!  It was a great combination of ingredients and flavors.  I enjoyed this very much and appreciated how simple it was and yet so delicious.

This place is not to be compared with Au Cheval because they make their burgers in completely different ways.  However, I really, really enjoyed the 3 burgers I tried and would definitely come back here if I'm looking for something above and beyond what Five Guys offers.

Great service and friendly employees (for pick up)... amazing burgers and fries... 5 stars!"
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Dillon R.,"Pricy, but delicious food and friendly service. I had the Barbacoa stacker and the chocolate cherry shake, and my girlfriend built her own. Portions were generous and our server was really attentive. I would definitely come back."
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Susie C.,"My friends and I came here for dinner on a Friday night for a party of about 12 people and 1 child. Reservations were made so we were able to get a table - however it didn't seem busy at all so a reservation may not have been needed. It's surprising to see that it's not busy on a Friday evening at 730pm. Anyway our service was pretty slow - our server seem MIA most of the time. It took awhile for him to get our order, to serve our food, and to get the check. Overall we all enjoyed our foods. My friend and I ordered their wings as appetizers  and felt they were very burnt. The taste was there, but burnt. I had the firehouse burger and I enjoyed it very much. We also ordered their 3 cheese mac and cheese - can't really tell there were 3 types of cheeses, more like just one type of cheese. 

They have a kid's menu too. Our friend's child had 2 mini sliders and 2 sides of fruits which was awesome."
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Courtney H.,"It's been a few years since we've been to Burger Bar, but it is exactly as we remembered. Self-explanatory, delicious menu ranging from mac & cheese to really inventive burgers. We could smell the searing meat when we opened out Uber driver's doors...and knew our burger craving would be satisfied. Nice beer list on draft. 
We had the Burger of the month (lots of porky toppings and a side of bone marrow) and the firehouse burger. Both were prepared to medium-rare (just as we asked), and the flavors didn't dissappoint."
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Catharine P.,"The food here was great. Tons of unique burger ideas and combinations, cooked well, and served with large sides. My family stopped in here for a very late lunch and the place was pretty empty. We were seated immediately and waited quite a while for our server to come over. She was sweet and suggested some of her favorites. My mom and I both ordered some beers to start and we ordered a basket of fried pickles as well. The restaurant has a large list of drat and bottled beers, with some local options as well. The fried pickles came out shortly after we ordered them. They were fresh, hot and served with a dipping sauce. They were amazing! Super delicious and fried perfectly. 

We then ordered different burgers. I ordered the gyro burger. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting but it did taste well. Disclosure: some of the burgers ingredients are still cold. If this bothers you, switch up your choice. 

Overall I will probably be back. I don't know if I would go to the city for this restaurant but if I was nearby I would definitely stop in again!

Apparently their milkshakes are really good too!"
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Jose R.,Awesome food great beer service was great my wife is pregnant and she made me drive 45min from the suburbs because she loves this place
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Peter L.,All I can say it's really tasty. Service was great the fries were perfect . The price was fair. So for a great Berger the is your place.
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Lizz M.,"I had Burger Bar bookmarked FOREVER, so when my fiance asked for a recommendation on a burger place, I took a chance to finally check this off my list. 

After a weekend of pretty heavy meals I decided to treat myself to a veggie burger. LOVED the veggie patty. It's not just a frozen patty. Not sure if it's vegan, but it's sure damn tasty. It paired lovely with the chipotle aioli and avocado. I asked for it without the goat cheese and didn't miss it. I got truffle fries as my side and they were okay. A bit too much oil for my taste. 

So, why the three stars? Service was nearly non-existent. We saw our waitress once to get our order, then to get our food, lastly, to grab a box for me and drop the bill off. My fiance's burger was made wrong, but we never got the chance to ask for her to fix it."
burger-bar-chicago-lincoln-park-chicago,Allie B.,Keep your beef burgers close and your shrimp burgers closer. This joint is phenomenal. The jicama slaw (or whatever it was) on that shrimp patty was absolute perfection. I also randomly got truffle fries (okay maybe I just paired the truffle fries with a shrimp burger because I'm human and don't turn down truffle fries) as a side and they were nothing short of spectacular. It's super easy to get to Burger Bar from the red line! No excuse to pass up this yumminess! Get there!
flo-chicago,Ryan M.,"While visiting Chicago, my friends brought me to Flo for a delicious brunch. Immediately when I walked in, I saw the Flo sign that had the New Mexico Zia Symbol, and I immediately felt at home (im from New Mexico). 

You do have to wait a but to get in, but Yelps nifty feature allowing you to check in ahead of time helped significantly. 

Food: We ordered the Fruity Pebble French Toast (holy moly, it was incredible), smothered burrito (it was large, and very flavorful), nd the green chile chicken chilaquiles (best dish of the bunch).  Each was plenty of food, and had great presentation. 

Drinks: We tried 2 separate bloody marys. 1 was a green chile bloody (so so so good), and the other was a red chile bloody mary (significantly thicker, but was still very tasty). 

Overall, this place was fantastic, and I cant wait to visit again when I am back in Chicago!"
flo-chicago,Stacey C.,"Flo is a poppin brunch spot with unique flavors and a modern, rustic atmosphere.  I stumbled across this spot when looking for bunch and after seeing some instagram worthy photos, glowing reviews, and realizing it was walking distance from my AirBNB I was sold.  We were a party of six, which at such a popular spot meant we had to wait a bit for a table (30 minutes) on Saturday.  

We got a comfortable round table in the back which was quieter than up front.  I started with a Chile Verde Bloody Mary which comes with a little Miller High Life.  The bloody is a refreshing take on an old classic being that it is green but still a little spicy.  For brunch I split the smothered ranchero burrito with my boyfriend.  It ended up being plenty of food for the both of us.  The burrito had layers and layers of flavor.  Flo had such a wide variety it could please anyone's tastes and would be worth multiple visits to try different things.  Next trip to Chicago I'll be sure to come back for more bold creations."
flo-chicago,Ariel W.,"I went here on a first date this past weekend after seeing Flo on a list of best places for brunch in Chicago. As soon as we were sat, our waitress immediately came over and asked for our drinks order, which she dropped off soon after. A few minutes later, she was back asking what we'd like to eat. We weren't ready (as we'd been chatting) and the server said she'd give us a few more minutes. I remember saying to my date, ""I'd better look at the menu before she comes back again"" and, lo and behold, a few minutes later she was back, asking if we were ready to order again. We were, with my date ordering the French toast and I the portabella tacos. The food arrived very quickly soon after. My tacos were adequate. Not bad, but nothing to write home about.

What bothered me about Flor is the service. Our server came over way too frequently. My date and I were having a conversation and she would interrupt us without waiting for a sentence to finish. Very rude.

This bothersome attention was because the server was rushing us through brunch so she could turn her tables over faster. We hadn't even finished our meals before the check was dropped off, which meant our waters and coffee were empty and our server completely disappeared until she came over to tell us it was time to leave as there was a line. We were barely in the restaurant an hour. Definitely not the relaxed brunch I was hoping for.

I'll be honest, I won't be returning to Flo and I plan to tell my friends to stay away. A server should never flat out ask me to leave but I guess because she'd already been given her tip, we weren't worth her time. Incredibly unprofessional."
flo-chicago,Julie S.,"I've been meaning to try this place for a while, and I'm glad I did. A couple friends and I came in for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon. It was pretty busy, but we had no problem getting a table in the back.

The funky abstract art, high ceilings, and dark wood booths make the inside cozy yet modern. Our waiter was friendly, but a little bit allusive. The menu is a decent size and mostly features breakfast/brunch dishes with a Latin flare. I had the turkey club which was toasty and delicious. The potatoes on the side were pretty bland, but they have a few different fun hot sauces to try. My friends both ordered the portobello tacos, which looked more like omelets, but they enjoyed them. I'm embarrassed to admit I didn't try one of their homemade margaritas or bloody Marys, so I will be back when I'm in the mood to day drink."
flo-chicago,Misty S.,"The food was really good and they have some fun items on the menu like the popular fruity pebble toast.  You can order them individually for $3.50.  I didn't have trouble finding street parking on a Sunday afternoon.

Bloody Mary $7 - They offer 3 different types - cholula, chile rojo and chile verde.  I went with the classic cholula and it came garnished with a pepper and an olive and was very salty.

Huevos Rancheros $9 - Cheddar cheese enchiladas topped with chile sauce, 2 fried eggs and black beans.  The enchiladas were swimming in sauce, and I rather enjoyed it.  The sauce was very good and everything tasted fresh.

Fruity pebble french toast $3.50 - Delicious!  It not only looked pretty, but tasted great with the fruit on top.

flo-chicago,Michael C.,"Flo--solid Latin American inspired brunch. Came with a group of 3 and we were seated in the front corner of the restaurant. We at first noted some questionable art work on the wall at a steep price point of $400 for a photo. 

Anyway we ordered a couple bloody marys and a champagne flight. strong bloody mary -- just wish they had some cheese on the skewer. I ordered the smothered burrito without a tortilla. First thing i noted were the great portion sizes. Sadly the flavors didn't match up. The chorizo was tasty but lacking in the heat department. Potatoes are fried but there is no crispiness ive had at other restaurants. Maybe that was the intent but some texture contrast is always appreciated.

Overall fine food and good service although the bill was given to us halfway into our meal. Decent brunch outing but left a bit unsatisfied."
flo-chicago,Shirley G.,"I loved this breakfast place! It was such a great way to start the day. They offer free unlimited coffee while you wait to get seated. There are plenty of tables. For a party of 4, we only had to wait about 15 minutes before being seated. 

We ordered the..
Fruity Pebbles French Toast
Skirt Steak Eggs Benedict 
Smothered Breakfast Burrito.

The french toast was surprisingly delicious, slightly on the sweet side but definitely not overly sweet. It was very unique and you probably won't find it anywhere else. My favorite goes to the skirt steal eggs benedict. The eggs were done to perfection!! The burrito was my least favorite, but it was still good.

Service was awesome as well! I would definitely come back if I am in town again."
flo-chicago,Anna M.,"My husband and I were meeting with friends for a late brunch and they live less 10 mins away from here. The reviews here were great so we thought it would be a perfect pick. There is complementary coffee by the door, so help yourself. They won't seat you until your entire party is there, but it wasn't too packed so I wasn't concerned. 

I ordered the Smothered Ranchero Burrito and my husband had the Steak and Eggs Benedict. My friend ordered a mimosa flight with her meal (forgot what it was) and her husband had the Chilaquiles special. Food came out pretty quick and was tasty. We felt rushed though since the busboy kept asking if we wanted boxes, and we were all still eating. 

The waitress dropped off the check while we were eating and chatting. When the busboy asked the second time around to pack up our food, we gave in and had things wrapped up. The waitress came around to see if she could grab the bill, and no, we weren't ready to pay since she dropped it off not too long ago. Also fyi, they will not split the bill for you. They'll only charge two cards equally, which we thought was silly. 

The waitress then swung by not too long afterwards and literally asked us to leave because they had people waiting to be sat. We were in the restaurant for less than an hour. We were all kind of taken aback by this. I get you want to make money on getting as many people in and out as quickly as possible, but probably not a great approach to kick out customers. 

I guess if you're looking to swallow your food without chewing and then be rushed out the door, this place is for you."
flo-chicago,Andrew D.,"A place deserves five-stars when you can conceivably find nothing wrong with it. Flo hits the mark on everything. Flawless, incredible experience every time I walk in. From brunch to dinner, everything on the menu is top notch. They're known for their brunch, specifically the Fruity Pebbles French Toast, which lives up to its' legend and is absolutely heavenly. I finally tried it here last weekend (on my third visit) and my dining companions were all snacking off my plate before I was even close to being done! That isn't to discount the incredible New Mexican offerings also found on both the brunch and dinner menu. Find me green hatch chile items elsewhere in Chicago! Tough to do. 

Drinks are a sleeper hit here, as well. Especially during brunch. All three bloodies hit the spot, and are available with vodka, tequila, or bourbon. The unique green chile bloody is my fave. 

Flo is a unique experience and one to be coveted, especially for brunch. Come for weekday dinner is you want to avoid the crowds, but even if you have to wait, it's worth it. Chicago Ave. between Western and the Kennedy has to be the best brunch stretch in all of Chicago!"
flo-chicago,Jazz S.,"I came here for dinner and thought it was very good, and then came back for brunch and was even more in love. 

Do yourself a favor and get the smothered burrito for brunch!!!! While it is not the most Instagram-worthy meal Flo has, it was the yummiest out of the ones we got (which is way more important right?). I got it with both the red and green sauce and both were delicious in different ways. They also have sauces available on the table. 

Tip: use the yelp waiting tool for weekends since they don't take reservations. This place is pretty busy but the line moves pretty quick because they being out the food fast."
flo-chicago,Lizzy N.,"Very eclectic menu. Mostly Mexican but some random non-Mexican items like the fried chicken special tonight and the mussels in white wine. Service was spotty - our server was basically uninterested in our party of five on an otherwise not very busy night.

The sangria is good - we tried both the red and the white. They're $20 a pitcher which is a decent deal. I preferred the red over the white, because the white was more watered down and had less flavor. My friends glass was badly cracked with a big chip off the lip. She brought it to the servers attention (it was bad enough that she could have easily sliced her lip) and no real apology or anything.

I had the short rib barbacoa tacos and they were just okay. They needed more flavor - without something extra hey we're just average tacos. The rice and beans were just basic and pretty flavorless.  All around it was fine but probably won't be back."
flo-chicago,Joseph N.,"Flllloooo! I wanted to hang out with a buddy and he suggested Flo...hadn't heard of it since I live across the city, so would have gone even if I didn't know HOW FANTASTIC IT IS!

I ordered a mimosa flight and the smothered burrito, which were both very good. There were a few different types of hot sauce on the table, which was a nice touch. The server was friendly and conversation was great...at this point Flo had a solid 4 stars going for itself. 

Then, I got the fruity pebbles french toast. I have a sweet tooth, so they were getting ordered no matter what, but DAMN! I had no idea that adding these little guys to some french toast with berries on it would set off a chain reaction of flavors and an orchestra in my mouth. Seriously...they're that good. Makes sense though, you have the berries already, but then each ""pebble"" has a different flavor, like cherry, lemon, grape, lime, but I mean WHOA! It was literally a flavor explosion (in a good way). You know how when there's something delicious and then you get to the point where it's almost too much? Yeah, this stops just before that point, so it's maximum awesomeness but without even straddling the line of too much. 

On the way home, I bought 10 boxes of fruity pebbles and started adding them to ever recipe I make:  breakfast smoothie, carrot cake, mandarin orange salad, bacon-wrapped filet...kidding, but that was what was running through my head during the first bite of this stuff. It's like my alternate life flashed before my eyes all in the span of a few seconds.

In all seriousness, next time you're in the hood, check this spot out, and please, I beg you, don't skip the fruity pebbles french toast."
flo-chicago,Salena C.,"Flo is my kinda brunch spot. A 15-20 minute wait at prime time weekend brunch hours. $7 mimosas (with ranging flavors: hibiscus, rose, peach, orange, strawberry, etc) and $7 bloody mary's. GREAT savory and sweet food options. I highly recommend the Cocoa Pebbles French Toast, and I know I'll be back for the Fruity Pebbles version very soon! Although not listed on the menu, the full portion is 3 pieces for $10, but you can also choose to get only 1 or 2 pieces for varying price values as well! 

Service isn't friendly per say, but they also aren't rude or inattentive. They are just straight to the point and get the job done! Parking is super easy too. Pay to park in front, or plenty of free parking on neighboring side streets.

I'll be back :)"
flo-chicago,Shanti I.,"I have had Flo for brunch and dinner.  Not too big of a fan of their dinner.  I haven't had their meat options but the vegetarian options don't seem to be tasty.  I did go there for brunch this weekend and enjoyed it far more than their dinner.  First of all, they have a really nice, dog friendly patio, though it is small.  It is also very affordable when it comes to their bloodies and food prices, which is a real treat given how expensive brunch can be.  I absolutely loved their bloody mary options (and they were only $7!).  We had the verde and roja ones and the verde was my favorite.  The verde one was spicy and zesty, the roja was good but not as exciting as the verde.  

Then for brunch, we had huevos rancheros and their chilaquiles.  They have many vegetarian options on the menu, which I really appreciated.  Their huevos rancheros had an amazing enchilada roja sauce with corn tortillas that were perfectly prepared.  There was some cheese in between the tortilla slices.  The eggs were over easy but it could have been cooked a bit less.  The chilaquiles were delicious as well, though I liked the sauce for the huevos rancheros more.  The tortilla strips were crispy with some finely shredded cheddar on top and more of a salsa roja sauce.  The portions were generous as well.  Service was good and appropriate.  Definitely coming back here more for brunch!"
flo-chicago,Judy M.,"I came here for the fruity pebbles French toast and it was worth the trip! It looked overwhelmingly diabetic-ally sweet but I promise it's not that bad. I don't like sweet sweets so if I can tolerate it, I'm more than sure most people can! I love the soft French toast with the crunchy cereal all drenched in a moderately sweet syrup. The other breakfast items are also very good."
flo-chicago,Belle L.,"Different taste in every bite.  How: line up the house salsas and open all tops, use different salsas in every bite [Barb Streisand style in 1996's The Man Has Two Faces].  A to-do for First Dates...fun!

Since the salsas are balanced (kick/spiciness doesn't linger), the GUADALAJARA SCRAMBLE is under seasoned but never bland.  Dude portion.  My first to wholeheartedly consume and enjoy the peppers.  Excellent slicing, ingredients and balance.

BIG SHOULDERS coffee beans.

Cocktails are nicely priced at $10.

Excellent SERVICE from Jane.  I appreciate your thoughtfulness Missy.  Thank you!  I can look forward to dinner with cocktails."
flo-chicago,Nicole S.,Friends and I went here for Saturday brunch during our visit in Chicago. The fruity pebbles French toast was a little too sweet but the fruit French toast was really good! The chicken enchiladas were decent. Customer service was sub par but they do give free coffee while you wait for a table.
flo-chicago,Victoria K.,"Nice Mexican inspired brunch spot in the neighborhood. The service is friendly, food options are yummy, drink menu is also good, and overall nice experience here!

We ordered the Strawberry Pancakes, Chorizo Scramble, and the Berry Smoothie.

The Strawberry Pancakes were fluffy and came as a stack of three big Pancakes! (You can also order just two for sharing if desired) There were enough Strawberry chunks in there in my option, the Pancakes were slightly sweet and made perfect with some syrup drizzle. 

The Chorizo Scramble was very flavorful. The beans were well seasoned, the scramble itself was delicious, but the potatoes were so bland! The potatoes look like they'd be tasty, but really just lacked flavor! Overall, this was a good dish, but 1/3 of the plate were potatoes and I barely touched those.

The Berry Smoothie was yummy, but not freshly made. It was poured from a container, probably made the day before. It was sweet, but did not taste all that natural."
flo-chicago,Marcella M.,"Perfect date spot! My coworker recommended this little joint, my fianc√© and I were very very pleased! They have a southwestern  feel to it (which I love I'm from Texas ) adding hatch green Chile to a handful of menu items.  We started with the guacamole and chips which were fireeeeee! I ordered the black bean burger with fries and my fianc√© had the skirt steak and a side of chicken tortilla soup, everything was amazing!! We will definitely be back for dinner and I'm also looking forward to trying their brunch menu!"
flo-chicago,Hong L.,"I didn't think this restaurant was anything special. I got the Flo egg white omelette and I wasn't even totally full after spending $9 on eggs and potatoes... the Asiago cheese was subtle and just noticeable enough without being too strong. The poblano sauce was bland though and the salsa verde on the table was barely enough to give the dish any flavor. The potatoes were also bland. The grapefruit juice was $4, which is a ridiculous amount to spend on juice imho. The fruity pebble trench toast didn't live up to my expectations either. I would have been happier eating a bowl of cereal. The service was friendly and quick, so no complaints there. I don't think I would come back."
fort-willow-chicago-3,Dan G.,"Amazing Experience! Amazing food! Amazing Service! Amazing drinks! A hidden gem? Not for long unfortunately!

My friends and I came here this past Saturday. The place itself is brand new with dark and woodsy decor and a big swing by the bar, forest meets city! Very speak easy!

I was greeted by the chef right away, she went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable! Also, our server was very attentive.

Food wise!! Definitely delicious food!! A variety of bites from all around the world from San Francisco to India to Mexico, we tried everything and everything is worth trying but the favorites were the Charred and Chilled Broccoli, Crispy rock shrimp and the meatballs! For dessert we had the horchata dessert! All the food was well cooked with tons of flavors and textures!

Drinks, I had a glass of wine and friends had some cocktails and mentioned they were good, definitely going back to try those! 

Overall great experience, top notch service and amazing food! Highly recommended!!"
fort-willow-chicago-3,Matthew Q.,"This place is amazing. Feel like you're walking into a speak easy. The food is awesome and staff is very friendly and fun. The chef will come out and visit and explain the dishes! Great date spot and the drink list is the very impressive.

Highly recommend!"
fort-willow-chicago-3,Ashley C.,"While I want to keep this gem to myself, this spot won't stay secret for long! Fort Willow, like Ada Street, is a bit off the beaten path on the industrial corridor on Elston. (Tip: Look for the neon sign on Willow Street for the entrance). The inside has a great ambiance. It is dark and cozy. The giant willow tree gives it a whimsical vibe. 

The plates are designed to be small and shareable so you can try more things (they are smaller than Ada and priced accordingly). The food is so good you don't always want to share - I ordered a second fluke crudo to myself! It has a around-the-world theme with dishes inspired by spices around the world. It is a different concept but very approachable. 

The cocktails were solid. I enjoyed the classics: champagne cocktail and dark n stormy. All very balanced but still boozy. 

The food is delicious! We had the Fluke Crudo (twice), Labneh, Crispy Cauliflower, Crispy Rock Shrimp, Crab Salad, and Korean Short Rib. Everything was tasty and spot on. My husband was surprised by how smooth the goat cheese was in the Labneh. The Fluke Crudo's scallion vinaigrette was banging and the pickled chiles provided the perfect balanced heat.  When it comes down to it, it is the food you just want to go back for more. 

The prices were reasonable. We had about 7 dishes (and were stuffed) and 4 cocktails for about $125. They also have some daily specials too which I am sure we will try. 

One thing to know: there are no reservations. It is first come, first served."
fort-willow-chicago-3,Brittany F.,"As a huge fan of Ada Street, I was extremely excited to try Fort Willow and it did not disappoint! Its taken over as my new favorite DMK restaurant. 

Ambiance: The design of the restaurant is amazing and the tree in the middle is the coolest thing I have ever seen. You immediately get a ""throwback to childhood"" feeling - there is even a hanging swing!  The setup of the tables allows the space to be both intimate and open. There is a line of booths that fit 4-6 people, a long bar across from them, a hightop and in the back, there is a large table that's covered so its like your own mini-fort. Perfect for celebrations. Every table was filled when we were there but it did not feel too crowded. The lighting is soft, the staff was all friendly and the music level was perfect. We could hear it but still hold a conversation. 

Food: YUM!!!!!! The food is fantastic. I love small plate menus as it allows you to try multiple items and not leave hating how full you are. There were 4 of us and we were able to try 10 of the 12 items, plus a second round of our favorites. My personal favorites were the labneh, cauliflower, rock shrimp and the meatballs. The people I were with also raved about the crudo, and I'm excited to go back and try it. 

Drinks: Unfortunately, I am pregnant so I was unable to try the cocktails. The Daisy Pusher was a huge hit with everyone else I was with though, along with the traveler's sour. Our waitress could not have been nicer and had the bartender make me a few ""mocktails"" so I could join in the fun. I can assure you, this does not happen at every restaurant and its always much appreciated when someone goes the extra step. 

We did have the bar peanuts while we were waiting for everyone to arrive. They gave us the heads up they typically come with anchovies when we ordered them so we simply requested them without. Easy enough. 

Price wise, we were surprised when we got the bill - in a good way. It was completely reasonable. I think the highest amount was about $10/$12 for one of the plates. We definitely got a full meal, several drinks and nobody broke the bank. 

It was one of their first few nights being open and everything ran smoothly from our view. Multiple people checked in with our table to ensure we were enjoying ourselves and we filled out comment cards at the end. Five stars to the staff, no question. 

Overall, we all loved our experience there, highly recommend it and we will all be returning!"
fort-willow-chicago-3,C C.,"Amazing spot for cocktails and tasty bites. I love the location and ambiance. Highlights :Cape route mule... it's gotta be one of the best cocktails I have ever had. I loved the short ribs, cauliflower and shrimp! The service was really strong too, I can't wait to come back!!!"
fort-willow-chicago-3,Goni M.,"We were very excited to try a new DMK spot, but this was a very disappointing experience say the least.
Start at the beginning -
This spot is located in an industrial area off of Elston.
Walked in the first the you notice in how small & narrow the place is.
We sat down & everyone was nice.
But don't let that fool you. 
The bartender asked if we wanted to try some bar peanuts speaking as if they were a complimentary bar snack
We said sure.. so a small soup cup arrived with peanuts & anchovies.. gross! Especially if your with a date & you have baby fish staring at you saying  eat me""
We get our drinks.. wine is served in a short glass, not a wine glass.. to keep up with the industrial, tree house feel.
Whiskey selection is VERY limited.
Plates of food looked very small for the price.
We were here on a Wednesday so it's 50% off for industry peoples drinks.
Moving forward, we got out bill because we wanted to get outta her asap.
They tried charging us 12$ for the disgusting peanuts we never er ordered in the first place.
It was taken off the bill & there was a discount for drink.
After we left we double check the bill & saw that they only took off the peanuts & a small amount for the drinks.
This is false advertisement!
Make sure you check you double check your tab & don't go on good faith like we associate with other DMK spots..
Giving this place less than a year to be a successful
business.
Hopefully company management will reach out   
so this situation can be resolved..
Best part about Fort Willow is the wooded tree focal point."
fort-willow-chicago-3,Michael M.,"Friendly staff, awesome cocktails, fantastic small bites.  Each cocktail was a twist on a classic, and super creative.  We will be back for sure."
fort-willow-chicago-3,Max K.,"This place is so cool and the food is awesome.  We ordered everything on the menu and loved al of it, particularly the big bite onion-soup grilled cheese with short rib. Highly recommend!"
fort-willow-chicago-3,Gwendolyn W.,Truly stylish and exquisite. Food was delicious without being pretentious or overly complex. Elegant flavors in both the food and cocktails. Will and Carly knocked it out of the park with their drink concoctions and outstanding customer service. Definitely worth a visit.
fort-willow-chicago-3,Kat C.,"Average cocktails and food. Tecate beer special at $2/beer was great news for some at our table, but at about 8:20 pm we were told by our waitress they had run out of it. I think the bar opens at 5 pm. Food was overpriced for small portions. Cocktails were average and filled with designer ice. The place looked great, however. Really cool space."
fort-willow-chicago-3,Melanie L.,What a trendy little spot. Met 4 girlfriends for drinks and bites and it was perfect! The only reason I'm docking any points was that the server was a little slow and couldn't explain what the wine special was. I might be a little bit snobby when it comes to wine so I'm probably exaggerating but in general she was a little slow. Food was AMAZING. The cauliflower was to die for! We ordered it again it was so good!
fort-willow-chicago-3,Jackie S.,"FORT WILLOW IS AWESOME! 
Right off the bat you are intrigued at the location and entrance of the building...very sneaky and discrete looking (almost like a speak-easy), the flashing neon ""Fort Willow"" sign is super cool! 
Parking is plenty! and the ""industrial"" feel of the place sets you up for HUGE surprise of the inside d√©cor! 
Giant wooden tree that encompasses the entire ceiling, with beautiful peaks of light that shine through., not too mention the tree swing, and beautiful wooden tables. 
Music is on point! mixes of oldies, jazz, 80s, and electronic. 
We sat at the bar, which was very welcoming and spacious with our bartender spot on with knowledge and assistance of the drink menu. 
Had the Noble Square Rye cocktail (amazing), switched up to beers (Miller High Life in a can) which gave us being in a "" Tree Fort"" feeling, super low key and chill. 
Food was OUTSTANDING! Literally tried every small bite on their menu: the star for us was the Lebenh (goat cheese with nann), the duck, and the spicy cauliflower! BOOM! We didn't leave hungry, and not overly full either! Perfect combo of drinks paired with delectable treats. Menu was so innovative and fresh! 
DMK does it again with Fort Willow! 
Looking forward to the changing menu and stopping in again and again!"
fort-willow-chicago-3,Jeremy D.,"Excellent first impression. The atmosphere is quiet and relaxing. The staff treated us so well and never left us wanting. Admittedly, the menu can seem underwhelming at first glance but of all the dishes I tried, I was not in the least bit disappointed. The Korean short ribs were like fireworks in my mouth and a close favorite to the crab salad. I'm really looking forward to see what the future holds for this place. I'll definitely be back."
frontier-chicago-2,Abigail H.,"An original concept and cool decor make Frontier a unique destination for group eats and drinks! I came for a birthday party with a party of 16 and we reserved a space on the second floor. There was nice ambience with a fireplace and cozy seats, as well as regular dining tables and access to a private bar. The manager came over and introduced himself to the birthday boy and the party hosts, which I thought was a friendly gesture. Our party's waitress was attentive and cleared plates and took timely drink orders throughout the night. The hosts had arranged for a round of drinks to be pre-purchased, so we each received drink tickets to use. Can't argue with a free cocktail and no line at the bar!

The food was excellent and we had a lot of it! The short ribs were delicious and salt salmon was the largest fish I have ever seen. Yummy sides made the meal indulgent, from five-cheese Mac and cheese to mixed vegetables, green beans and Caesar salad. Other guests had arranged for a birthday cake to be refrigerated then brought out after the meal, which the Frontier staff was gracious enough to not only accommodate, but also cut and plate for us. There was a simultaneous engagement party happening on the other side of the second floor, but there was no disturbance whatsoever. I recommend you check this out for your next event!"
frontier-chicago-2,Colleen Q.,"Enjoyed dinner here during restaurant week. I ordered the Ahi Tuna Sandwich and was not let down. It was delicious! 
My boyfriend ordered the Restaurant Week special, which I taste tested (for his safety, of course). The three course meal began with 3 small duck tacos topped with pineapple. Next up... Sirloin cooked perfectly medium and frites. Finally... a waffle for dessert. Let me tell ya... I am NOT a sweets person. I'd order extra fries or another app before ordering a dessert. BUT THIS WAFFLE, this waffle was soooo tasty. It is a must! 
5 Stars for this joint. I love it!"
frontier-chicago-2,Justine R.,"My first visit here (Seriously - why have I waited this long?!) was this past weekend. It was a perfect Sunday night date night! From our server, to the prix fixe selections, to the atmosphere - everything was perfect. 

My husband & I came for Chicago Restaurant Week, one of our favorite foodie ""holidays"" of the year. We made sure to not order the same items to maximize our prix fixe options. Plus, we're married. What's mine is his. Not necessarily vice versa, but I decided to play nice. So altogether we were able to try: BBQ Duck Salad, Duck Tacos, Wagyu Beef Back Ribs, Wagyu Sirloin, Waffle & Gelato, and a Brownie & Ice Cream.

Overall I feel like these were choice selections. The wagyu beef back ribs were definitely the winning dish, partially because the cheese grits that accompanied them were super good (read: super cheesy). I loved the espresso ice cream that topped the brownie too - I would have been happy with just a scoop (or two) of that alone for dessert! But I'm also not complaining about the pairings ;) 

I can't wait to come back on warmer nights - the patio and lounge areas looked so cozy!"
frontier-chicago-2,Kyle D.,"Overall: If you want to try a variety of game, look no further than Frontier. Whether you're on a date or with a big group, it's sure to satisfy.

The good: A very shareable atmosphere/venue, and our party of 13 was a great fit for this experience. The wagyu beef was the star of our meat trio option, but the sides were also all fantastic. The mac and cheese was creamy and plentiful, the caesar salad was massive, and the polenta ""croutons"" were unique and tasty. The sauteed veggies were a tad too oily but still hit the spot.

The not-so-good: The venison was incredibly disappointing, especially because it was an ""upgrade"" to the 3-meat deal that we got. It was tough and chewy and we had a lot left over as a result. Also, the place is a little too expensive. $40 average for sharing a meal...I was full, but that's also $10 probably too much (without drinks). The service was fine, but nothing too memorable for what could've been.

Atmosphere: 8/10
Service: 8/10
Food: 8/10"
frontier-chicago-2,Bailey M.,"New Years Eve 2017 Review:

We bought early bird tickets for around $100 after fees and taxes. We also reserved a 4 person table. I always recommend reserving a table wherever you go just to have somewhere to sit, 10 of us split the cost of the table so it ended up being around $16 each. We usually rotate sitting all night and it works out perfectly. This time the 4 person table next to us which was actually 4 people seemed kind of annoyed that we had a 4 person table for a group of 10, but we're not all made of money here so I got over their annoyed looks!

Positives:

The drinks were very strong!

Our waitress for our table was great, she came by often to take our order for drinks and brought them back in a reasonable amount of time.

The staff overall was friendly and helpful.

There was plenty of space, you didn't feel that people were on top of you.

They had several punch bowls that were self serve so you were never out of drinks.

The bar lines were never too long.

The food was pretty good, they had boar, pig, goat, and lamb. All the meat was shredded and put into containers so it wasn't a whole roast. They had barbeque sauce to put on the meat. The sides were salad, mac and cheese, oysters, mixed vegetables and bruchetta. For dessert they had cookies and fruit.

Negatives:

There wasn't a DJ or a dance floor. Music was playing and they had the tv screens on, but I feel like you lose the new years vibe when you don't have a dance floor or DJ. However, the layout of this restaurant is broken into three seperate areas (two downstairs seperated by a wall in the middle, and an upstairs area). So I guess it would be hard to create that vibe given the layout of this restaurant. You just need to know going into it, that this is going to be more of a eat, drink, and talk with your friends type of place rather than dancing and jamming to the music.

Overall we had a good time, it's just important to know what you are looking for. If you want more of a dance environment this isn't the place to go. If you prefer to stand around drinking and eating with friends, then this is a good place for that as there was plenty of room and you could easily hear each other."
frontier-chicago-2,Anthony M.,"A group of 13 friends and I went to Frontier tonight for the whole animal experience...well, sort of. We actually got the Frontier meat trio, but more about that later! 

I saw on their website that they have some pretty great party rooms and even a year round tent. With 14 people, I would have thought they would have put us somewhere there. However, they brought together multiple tables in the bar area and had us sit right next to the door. I thought that was a bit strange. 

We ordered our drinks. I tried the Cranberry Gin Buck. It was a bit of a twist on a Moscow Mule. I loved it so much that I got another one later in the meal. A few of my other friends got wines and some special beers. If you are looking for a unique drink, this is the place to be! 

As for the meal, we got the meat trio which included the following for all: 

Wagyu Beef: This was cooked medium rare and was my favorite of the three meats. I have had beef like this before so I knew what to expect. I think it might have taken a few in my party for a surprise. It was also the smallest of the three meats so everybody only got a piece or two. It was also the most expensive of the meats so I understand there isn't an abundance. They also didn't give us very good knives to cut these. 

Boar Shoulder: This was more of a pulled pork kind of setup. However, it was outstanding as well. Very well seasoned and a little tender. Think of the best pulled pork and double the goodness to get a Boar Shoulder 

Venison Leg: This was the most meat we got. Another tender choice, but the interesting thing was that some of it seemed cooked a bit on the well done side and some was still pretty rare. That is not a bad thing as everybody had a choice at what kind of ""done-ness"" they wanted 

Dinner Rolls with Garlic butter: Pretty self explanitory, but still awesome...I wish there were more! 

Salad with Polenta Croutons: A fantastically large salad with fantastically large croutons. One of the better salads I have ever had and the croutons were good and interesting! 

Mac and Cheese: Brought out in a large pot! This is the item I wished I could have gotten more of. There wasn't enough really for 14 people, but we might all be Mac and Cheese hogs (no pun intended) 

Seasoned Vegtibles: Didn't eat them, but they smelled great! 

We also got a horseradish and BBQ sauce for our meats. Both were outstanding and great mixed together. My plate looked like a mess so many flavors got mixed for a mind blowing experince! 

The only thing that disappointed me about this part of the meal were the smaller portions for some of the sides and that there wasn't really any showmanship with the carving. I thought it was going to be a bigger to do, but it ended up being just a guy carving the meats very well. Maybe I set the bar too high for this part! The service was good, but not great. Not that anything went wrong, but I expected the service to be out of this world. Again, perhaps I set the bar too high. 

For dessert, we got both the brownie ala mode with espresso ice cream and the old fashioned blueberry and tarragon doughnuts. They were both outstanding!  The doughnuts were different flavors, but worked together with the lemon ice cream! 

In closing, I liked this place, but I thought I would have loved it more. The food and drinks are great, but I was hoping for a little more ""umph"" with the presentation and service. Either way, I will be back! There are many more items on the menu I would like to try and explore! I would highly recommend the animal service. Its great and something a little different to do in the city!"
frontier-chicago-2,Andrea H.,"We had our wedding reception in the 2nd floor lounge at Frontier and we are absolutely over the moon about how wonderful the experience was.  Our guests cannot stop raving about how much they loved the space and how delicious the food was and we could not agree more.

We knew that we wanted to have our reception at Frontier from the very beginning.  How could we resist the whole animal service?  In particular, the alligator.  We had to have the alligator.  He even had a name, Gary, the Party Gator.  We were very excited about this and couldn't wait for Gary to surprise our guests.

We booked Frontier right away and, from the beginning, the event coordinator, Jen, was awesome to work with.  I operate events for a living so I am very concerned about every little detail.  I sent Jen some massive emails with lots of questions and she was prompt and very responsive throughout the entire planning process.  She even made sure that our requested menu modifications for food allergies were taken care of.  She was great!

One concern I had was the possibility of running out of some of the food items.  The animal service comes with guidelines about how many people the animal and sides will serve.  We ordered two animals that were listed to serve between 10 - 15 people each.  With 40-ish guests, I was sure we'd run out of some of the meat and sides so I ordered a bunch of extra stuff.  As it turned out, we didn't run out of anything.  Far from it, actually.  We had a ton of food left over and Gary even came with two brothers, Gerald and Gil.  It was so great to not have to worry about running out of food, and our guests even had a chance to take some home.

As far as the food went, every single thing was absolutely delicious!  I made sure to try everything.  After looking at the menu descriptions for a few months, I had to.  It was all amazing, even the stuff I didn't think I'd like.  I was so full, I thought I was going to die but I still wanted to go back for more.  Luckily, we still have some mac and cheese and 'gator leftovers to enjoy at home.  That 'gator was so tasty.  We loved the smoky goodness!

I was also very impressed with the staff.  We stopped by a couple of times before the event and they were great about walking the space and answering questions.  The staff on the evening of the event knocked it out of the park.  They made sure all of my requests were fulfilled and every detail was covered.  They always had smiles on their faces, were always right there to help when needed, and even packed up the leftovers for us without being asked at the end of the night.  

I can't rave enough about how happy we were with the evening.  I feel like I have unbelievably high standards and Frontier far exceeded my expectations.  We're so so so so happy!  I would not hesitate to host another event there.  In fact, we may just need to find another reason to throw a party!"
frontier-chicago-2,Yvonne I.,"New Years Package Review (4.5 Star NYE):

I noticed that there weren't many reviews about the NYE celebration that they hold here every year, so I decided to add my two cents.  

Positives:
-Not overly crowded.  The first and second floor were opened up to allow guests plenty of room to move around.
-Friendly staff members.
-Ability to book reasonably priced tables ahead of time for your group.  Most other restaurants and bars in Chicago have table reservation rates starting at $200+ for NYE.  The 4 person table at Frontier was $125 before taxes and other fees.  
-The food was filling and as advertised. The food was served buffet style and offered chilled oysters, 3 meats, some sides, and desserts.  Unlike some other places that I've been to for NYE, they did not run out of food.  
-Delicious tasting cocktails.

Negative:
-There was a limited cocktail menu available (About 5 or 6 total).  Many of the cocktails I tried were excellent, but I was surprised that they weren't able to make other common cocktails.  They could make cocktails like cranberry and vodka, but not ones like an old fashioned.  This wasn't a huge negative, but just something I didn't expect."
frontier-chicago-2,Keisha H.,"Here for an event 

The staff was wonderful space was amazing couldn't had. Asked for a better day. 

Shout out to chef Jupiter the food was amazing. The potatoes were my fav! zhane, and Jessica went above and beyond. Fidele the bartender was great!  If I had an event I would be honored to have them work any of my events or serve when I come to enjoy this place. 

Overall great service, amazing food, amazing time. Everyone was helpful with last minute changes and very accommodating. 

Two thumbs up!!"
frontier-chicago-2,Tiffany F.,"Enjoyed this place so much!!!! We had been wanting to try it for a while now because of the AWESOME happy hour specials and were finally able to make it. They have fros√© (frozen ros√©) and Moscow mules for $5! Can't beat that. It's also awesome because it goes until 7 which is just unbelievable. The outdoor(ish) patio is such good vibes too. We really enjoyed it. 

We also got some oysters which were part of the happy hour as well. I didn't try the oysters but everyone else said they were good. We got pork empanadas as well as hummus and both were good as well. I'd like to go back here especially for the happy hour, but also for just a meal in general. Overall everything looked really good."
frontier-chicago-2,Fred A.,"Dark, large, gastropub. Not necessarily a destination, really, but a strong neighborhood hot spot.

I only tried the zucchini fries, which were too greasy IMHO, but the spicy raisin puree beneath them and the chimichurri sauces were both good. The food around us looked pretty good. The menu items looked creative, so points for that. I know they have a whole pig roast or something, which is neat.

Pretty solid beer selection, especially as far as bottles/cans go. I can't speak to the cocktails much -- my friend only ordered margaritas, surprisingly.

For a Friday, it really cleared out by 11PM. The second, larger room had cozy couches and a fireplace, which looked cool. The crowd was just the right amount of young, yuppies, without any obnoxious bros. This heavy set man at the table next to me would had zero voice control, but I digress."
frontier-chicago-2,Jacob H.,"Made a reservation that coincided with ""restaurant week,"" and my birthday. 
Arrived and was asked to wait at the bar before being given a high top for two. 

We ordered our beers and food from the coursed out menu. Boy did I have high expectations.... and I was very let down. 

Frontier was busy and the first night of ""Restaurant Week"" I'm sure took a toll on the back of house. 
But all the tables around us with the same server were being served relatively quickly, but not us. After many nervous glances from Caroline our server, we finally received our first courses from the back. Duck tacos and duck salad. Tacos were great.  
Duck salad was fine- minus the cartilage we pulled out from the meat and set aside on one of our extra sharing plates. A runner/manager came and saw the hard piece of duck and asked if we were done with it. Really? Yes. I don't want the hard left over joint that your kitchen didn't pull out. I'm done with it. 

We ordered a side of Mac and cheese as an extra side (9 dollars) and it arrived during the first course. Damn. Was hoping they would have coursed this out better. So Mac sat while we finished and waited for our entree course. On top of that, this 9 dollar Mac and cheese was quite a small portion for the steep 9 dollar price tag. I looked around to see if anyone else got a different size and maybe we were mistakenly given a smaller side portion by mistake. No such luck. 

We both ordered the steak and frites. A small medium rare steak, and a full plate of fries. Fries were greasy and soft, as well as a 1/4 of an inch long - not worth the bites. I planted my rosemary branch garnish in it and told my wife it's Christmas. She rolled her eyes as she didn't finish her steak. 
And as if it were a sign that they wanted us gone - dessert came in the middle of our entrees. Damn. Was hoping they would have coursed this out AT ALL. 
sigh* 
Dessert was lack luster. But we got to them before the ice cream had melted all the way at least. 

I was very excited to try frontier for the first time - and after 120 dollar bill, and left feeling hungry and thirsty and disappointed... it was not a 120 dollar experience. Not even a 60 dollar experience. 

Very Disappointed."
frontier-chicago-2,Jessica P.,"AMAZING EXPERIENCE! We visited Frontier for restaurant week. The food was incredible - Favorites included duck tacos, BBQ duck salad, and  waffles & ice cream. The Cranberry Gin Buck cocktail was dangerously delicious. 

In addition to the incredible food, the General Manager, Garrett, blew us away with his hospitality. We were a bit stir crazy and decided to bring our 4-week old baby to Frontier for dinner. Garrett found us THE perfect seat to accommodate our baby. Since we had to wait a few minutes extra for this perfect seat, Garrett generously treated us to a complimentary drink and appetizer, and he checked on us throughout our meal. As new parents in a hip bar, Garrett made us feel unbelievably special and welcome. 

We will 100% be visiting Frontier again!!!"
frontier-chicago-2,Leila M.,"Wowie Zowie. Sometimes me and Sam are feeling kinda wimpy. Kinda bored. I make Sam eat vegetables, but Sam isn't really a veggie guy, some would say. And thats where Frontier date night steps in. You think you're gonna get a fucking vegetable here? YOU'RE NOT! WE'RE GONNA ROAST A FULL BLOWN HUNK OF MEAT FOR DATE NIGHT, BABY! 

I almost cried the first time we came here because I don't like eating only meat and potatoes. It upsets me. So I forced Sam to include an appetizer that could potentially have some nutrients. We ordered some bacon, cheese filled, dates. And holy shit! They were not remotely healthy, or contain anything that made me feel better about what I was eating. But DAMN! They were lit as hell. We ate those up. They came on skewers, and I was blocking Sam from eating them. I was like, nah! I ordered this!! EAT YOUR DAMN LEG OF MEAT! LEAVE MY VEGGIE ALONE!

But the meat is crazy too. Sam put bones in his mouth, and I ate a venison leg. He was pissy because he wanted to order that, but I held my ground. And it was a great idea.

Sam and me got drunk here too, on accident. It was just so good! I didn't want to leave! It was cool and it felt like I was in someones uncle's house thats always like, ""you should come visit my uncle with me sometime! He lives in Niles, but he has a smoker!"" and I'm hesitant but, the meat is good.

That was kind of too much, but still, hopefully you get the picture. Frontier is lit and meaty, and I have a burly chest and own an axe after eating there."
frontier-chicago-2,Reed S.,The bartender there was great. Super helpful and made awesome recommendations for drinks.
frontier-chicago-2,Mile N.,"Deliriously Delicious! Came for brunch on a whim and was blown away.  Had the beignets, bacon flight, chicken biscuit sandwich, and smoked boar hash.  Loved it all, the lamb bacon and chicken biscuit were my favorites.  Service was superb."
frontier-chicago-2,Maria R.,I absolutely love the atmosphere here very cozy and warm. The food for me was on point.  I really liked it there. I went there for an engagement party and it was really nice the drinks were awesome. I would definitely like to go there again and just have dinner with my husband. My only issue was looking for the valet and making sure he was actually the valet LOL.
frontier-chicago-2,Lynette H.,"The whole animal dinner here is incredible!! A group of us had dinner last night for my cousin's birthday and had the best time. My cousin's husband reserved back in November. Not sure what the standard timeframe is for the reservation. 

They set up a side table to display the food you ordered and have someone slice it all before you. We ordered the wagyu beef, boar shoulder, and goat leg. It was all so delicious. My favorite was the goat leg. There were also great sides, the best mac and cheese I have ever had, a vegetable stir fry, bread, and caesar salad. I was so full but honestly couldn't stop eating. Great sign! 

The menu suggested 8-10 people for the meal, but it definitely could have fed at least 13 people. 

The cocktails are good, all are $13. They also have a variety of beers as well. 

The service is great, the staff is friendly, and the restaurant is cozy."
frontier-chicago-2,Stephanie R.,"The food was fine - a bit oversalted and not mindblowing in terms of flavor. The service was definitely lacking, however. From not getting the right beer, to our entrees coming out at totally different times, the service seemed completely disorganized. And then we had to keep fighting to keep things on the table as bussers kept trying to clear plates that weren't even finished. Overall a lackluster experience."
frontier-chicago-2,Jenny J.,"I was not impressed at all with this establishment, and probably will not return. The wait staff was terrible, and they wouldn't even come to the table to check on us.  The cocktails and appetizers were tasty, but the lack of good customer service is a major turn off.  Also, a man was allowed to smoke cigars right outside the door. He asked the worker if it was ok, and the worker said yes! As a result, the man's friends all lit their cigars as well! I almost died as I waited for my ride! I could have sworn that smoking close to buildings in Illinois is illegal!!!!"
ameer-kabob-chicago,Sejal P.,"Ordered on Grubhub for pickup, which seems to be large portion of their business.  I noticed a lineup for delivery orders on the counter while restaurant itself was prepared for closing.  Chairs stacked on top of table, employees cleaning floor etc 

Busy location seems to know what they are doing.  I picked up two platter of chicken, and two falafel plates.  Everything was good and my family really enjoyed the meal.  I did find the rice was slightly under cooked but few extra min in the microwave fixed that.

I'll order from here again, although this time I'll have it delivered.  I had hard time finding their location and the street wasn't cleaned after blizzard so driving in this area was difficult."
ameer-kabob-chicago,Chara B.,"Ameer kabob is always solid and reliable. 

I've never dined in but have only gotten delivery either through grub hub or by calling the restaurant directly. The food always comes within 45 minutes and is always super hot and ready to eat! The beef and chicken kabobs are awesome and grilled and always cooked perfectly. Their pita sandwiches are also awesome, I really enjoy them. Additionally, the lentil soup is on point! 

Also, the customer service is beyond awesome, everyone is always nice and accomdating.. never had an issue.

Definitely stand behind this place and recommend it!"
ameer-kabob-chicago,Samia K.,"With so many Mediterranean restaurants in Chicago, it's difficult to really shine. But this restaurant managed to stand out with its amazing hummus and customer service. We really like their chicken shawarma sandwiches and Kefta kabobs. Their food is fresh and portions are generous. The sitting area is not flashy, but a good spot to have a quick bite and good conversation.

Edit: I just got my first delivered meal and it's amazing! They made sure they didn't leave anything out and everything was just as good as when we dined in. They gave us an order of free falafel and pita as well. Thank you!"
ameer-kabob-chicago,Sean S.,"I was working at the Vittum Theater for the College Improv Tournament and picked up the Chicken Kabob Entree - Chicken, rice, some vegetables and a side salad for dinner.  The kabob and rice were great.  Ended up getting busy and not able to try the vegetables or salad.  Good portion and reasonably priced."
ameer-kabob-chicago,Eman S.,"Ive ordered on GRUBHUB multiple times to River North
From a middle eastern point of view: Very Very Very Solid! I love it...Order 3 meats with all the fixings and its a feast and simply delicious."
ameer-kabob-chicago,Jessica S.,"We ordered from Ameer Kabob last night and it was great! I had the Beef Shawarma Sandwhich, which was delicious. The pita was full to the brim with beef and had some lettuce and tomato as well. My husband had the chicken kabob entree which he said was great. The Tiramisu and Baklava was great and had a lot of flavor. The pita and falafel was delicious dipped in the homemade hummus. I would recommend both.  All of the food was reasonably priced. We will be ordering from here again!"
ameer-kabob-chicago,Bethany W.,"The salad with kabob chicken was enormous! Easily could have fed 2 or 3 people, so you really get a lot for your money. They definitely do not skimp on the chicken or any other toppings! The pita bread croutons add a delicious crunch to the salad, and it wasn't super oily like some Mediterranean places tend to make their food. Ordered my meal for delivery and it was much quicker than anticipated. Overall great experience and would definitely order again so I can try more of their food!"
ameer-kabob-chicago,Nyla H.,Best chicken shawarma sandwich money can buy (& only $6!) + a generous serving of lentil soup for $3. Pricing and delicious food on point!
ameer-kabob-chicago,Katie P.,Best Mediterranean delivery. The chicken shawarma is so good and delivery is super fast.
ameer-kabob-chicago,Jennifer Y.,I found this place on grub hub bc I was in UIC hospital and starving for some delicious food. The delivery driver was very accommodating and said he would deliver to my room. I am now addicted to this food. The beef Kebobs and chicken shawarma are my favorite! The house salad that they give you with the ameer platter was delicious. Everything down to dessert was fabulous. You have a new customer for life!
ameer-kabob-chicago,Thomas V.,"Wow, just wow!
I'm not a very big fan of Mediterranean food, I can confidently say this place has changed me.
Every single thing we ordered from here was superb.
The food tasted and smelt so fresh my mouth waters now by just the thought of it.
We ordered the chicken shwarma sandwich and rice plate that tasted fantastic, but the biggest surprise came in the form of the stuffed grape leaves, splendid stuff.
The only reason I give them 4 instead of 5 stars is because the Tabuoleh salad was a tad less in taste than expected.
Otherwise, among the best food we e have had delivered home in a long long time."
ameer-kabob-chicago,Karen M.,"Hands down, top favorite Mediterranean kitchen. Better than Pita Inn by a smidge. I would write a longer review but my food just got here. Just try this place, please. For your own good."
ameer-kabob-chicago,Shanta√© E.,"Came here while on lunch break ordered the vegetarian combo which consisted of grape leaves, hummus, baba ganoush, tabouli and falafel patties. I also opted for a piece of baklava which I can't resist anytime I visit a Mediterranean restaurant. Everything was fresh and super tasty. The prices were reasonable and the wait time wasn't bad (I think it took about 15min). It looks like a small family owned business, clean, not much seating on the inside but it was pretty empty while I was there, it was a little after 1:00pm so maybe I missed the noon rush. This place may not have the glitz and glamour of other places however the quality of the food definitely makes up for it. I'll be back in the future."
ameer-kabob-chicago,Ameer S.,"Simple Arabic food with a friendly staff. The prices are great for sandwiches. I loved the spot and frankly I'm biased given that my name is Ameer, which means, ""Prince."" The owner told me that even though his name is not Ameer, he's ""the prince of kabob."" I agree."
ameer-kabob-chicago,Khatera R.,"I have ordered from them three times now. The delivery was quick and the order correct every time. I have gotten the chicken shwarma and beef shwarma plates with rice. They are on the spicy side but not overwhelming. Comes with a generous helping of meat, rice, and a side of pita bread and salad. The portions are generous. The salad is a Middle Eastern salad with cucumbers, tomatoes, and lettuce. I have had the fries and they were decent (same as Chinese take-out fries). Baba ganoush and hummus were good. Wish they had a white sauce (i.e. yogurt sauce). The falafels are only okay (most likely they fry up frozen pre-made ones)."
ameer-kabob-chicago,Josh E.,"I really liked Ameer Kabob's chicken kabob, until My parents and I got food poisoning. No more kabobs for me :("
ameer-kabob-chicago,Diana J.,Got the chicken and beef combo for carry out.  The chicken and beef were kind of dry and bland tasting. When I asked for some hot sauce they gave me the Chinese sriacha kind with the seeds. Wasn't anything special - I've had a lot better elsewhere. Food was plentiful for $10 but the taste was very meh. Won't be coming back.
ameer-kabob-chicago,Mohammed S.,I work in a hospital and doing a late night shift had ordered food from here . Around the time of delivery I received a page from the ER and had to go down there where the reception is poor . By the time I got out it was half hour later . I called the restaurant who confirmed that the delivery person had tried calling me multiple times and left when they couldn't reach me . As per my request they immediately sent the food back to me again . Love this place
ameer-kabob-chicago,Kevin P.,The food is decent but not good enough for waiting for 30 minutes just for 2 sandwiches to be made for carry-out. They spent the whole time preparing meals for take out and delivery orders while neglecting the one order from an actual customer who is in their restaurant in person!!! No apologies for the wait...
ameer-kabob-chicago,Kristine A.,"Really good hummus, shawarma, and kebabs. Good plate deal with plenty for leftovers. There's a three meat plate so you can have a some of a lot of things. Falafel isn't my favorite, but that might just be because I've always had it delivered. They might be better fresh. The hummus is flavorful and isn't bland."
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Vivian L.,"I found this gem using Yelp and used Yelp Reservations to book a table for two tonight. I've had this restaurant bookmarked for awhile and was super excited to spend our belated Valentine's Day dinner here! 

Our server, Hector, had provided us with exceptional service from beginning to end. He started us off with bread that came right out of the oven and recommended options on both their regular menu and Valentine's Day menu. 

We ended up getting a glass of ros√© and a 1/2 dozen of baked clams for appetizers. As for entrees, my boyfriend ordered grilled octopus with lemon and I had the Linguine con Gamberi Provinciale (which I butchered pronouncing to Hector) which had shrimp, mushrooms, and tomatoes saut√©ed with garlic butter and white wine sauce!

The baked clams were a little too chewy for my liking but the flavors were pretty good and the sauce went really well with the bite. Both entrees were incredible -- pasta was cooked al dente, and the white wine sauce was light and POPPIN! The octopus was nicely charred, zesty, and had the perfect amount of tenderness inside. So good... devoured the octopus but didn't have enough room to finish my pasta! :( 

Incredible experience overall! Hector had also let us know that they can also host private events for parties of 40-50 people in their space! If you're looking for a cute, romantic place for your next gathering, go to Oggi!"
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,John I.,"I guessed that ""Oggi"" must be someone's name, or perhaps another nickname like for grandma or grandpa, like ""nanna"" Turns out that it translates to ""today,"" and Google Translate's voice pronounces it like, ""Awe' gee."" The name, then, is fitting, because if someone asked me to eat here again, I'd say, ""Awe, gee, I can't wait!""

It was a Saturday afternoon and a friend had suggested having dinner at one of our well-worn Italian go-tos, a bus and two el rides from my humble South Loop abode. I quickly snapped into action and what did I find? Lo and behold, Oggi had great Yelp and still had 7:30 reservations available for the five of us. Long story short, four of us arrived at 7:30, and the folks at Oggi had no problem changing the reservation to four of us.

Oggi is definitely my kind of restaurant: a small, humble storefront with a reasonably-priced menu and servers that dish-up TLC with each order. We started with drinks; I had never tried a Tasca red wine, and it was pleasing enough to my palate to warrant a second glass with my meal.

The four of us shared a Caesar salad as a starter, and it was just enough to hit the spot. For my main, I went with the Oggi Special Pasta, which has a Matarocco sauce--a blend of diced tomatoes, garlic, and olive oil. It was tasty enough, though nothing good enough to warrant a letter back to the old country. My gluten-free friend was overjoyed to learn that not only did they offer gluten-free pasta, but that she could do so with any pasta on the menu. She enjoyed her gnocchi with seafood; my other friends enjoyed their veal parmigiana and rigatoni arrabiata. 

Perhaps the highlight of the night for me was the side orders we placed for spinach and broccoli, both arriving with a zealous amount of garlic. I added some of the spinach to the Oggi Special Pasta, and it made it much more special indeed."
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Mina N.,"This is one of THOSES places you stop in maybe because you drive by or a friend had a party there. But once you try it. It becomes that place , The MY Place .

This is a family business that has taken the time to do it right.   I love this place love the staff and love the food.

I highly recommend a visit and I guarantee you will find it a must recommend and must remember to visit."
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,David F.,"The hardest part of moving to Austin, was not being able to order Oggi anymore. Their food had become the very definition of comfort food in our house, particularly the rigatoni al forno, which is my wife's favorite dish. In. The. World. She'd come home from work and have it delivered for a perfect tv-sweat pants-and-pasta kind of night. This was such a regular occurrence, they knew the order. 
We've tried tons of places over the last three years, but nothing has compared to Oggi and my wife often commented on how much she missed it. So for her birthday, I called and asked Isaac if it would be possible to send some rigatoni al forno to Austin. He said yes! He took the time to prep the food for shipping and gave me step by step instructions of how to prepare it. I can't think of another restaurant that would go to that much trouble just for two orders of pasta (which were absolutely amazing). That kind of service, in addition to incredible food is hard to come by and makes me miss this place even more."
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Sonal B.,"Oggi trattoria serves one of the best pastas I have ever had. Went for dinner the past week. The place has a warm, cozy vibe. Lucy and her son Issac were very friendly and made us feel at home. For starters, I ordered baked clams which were cooked to perfection. The shrimp pasta (linguine con gamberi provinciale) was amazing. The shrimps were fresh and really sweet and the pasta was cooked al-dente. The chicken in marsala sauce was ok. The highlight was their tiramisu, So light and creamy like a piece of heaven. It was absolutely divine.
Would highly recommend this place not only for their great food but also for their hospitality and service."
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Nicola P.,"My friend brought me here for dinner, and we ended up closing the place down :)

It's family owned and the couple is very lovely. The decor is simple and quaint, the to food is delectable. Now, in the three and a half hours we spent there talking and laughing, we shared three appetizers, a basket of rolls, and a phenomenal dessert, not minding at all that we didn't go the traditional route. 

The components of the Caprese salad are exactly what I'm looking for in this dish: beefy tomatoes, plump mozzarella slices, fresh basil, a drizzle of balsamic and a couple of kalamata olives and pepperoncini.
It was light and crisp.

The Grilled Octopus was sizeable and tender, the lemon sauce out-of-this-world tangy (I used three biscuits to finish it) and very fragrant. The plate was pretty much clean when we finished it.

My friend and I are not into a lot of fried foods, so we went with the Grilled Calamari and had a debate as to which was better, the Octopus or the Calamari. Um.....we still don't know. :)

The Limoncello cake was one of the best desserts I've ever tried due to the refreshing decadent texture of the cake. I would've indulged in a second piece, but we looked around to find we were the only couple left in the place. 

The owners didn't mind and were very gracious to us as we left-- I honestly felt like I had come to a private dinner party. 

Our experience was so cozy and casual, I will be back :)"
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Julio R.,This is my favorite Italian restaurant in the city! The food is always amazing and never disappoints. I haven't had one bad thing off the menu and probably tried everything. Always great hospitality and treated well since the first time I've ever stepped foot inside the place. I highly recommend!!!
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Nina J.,"Take the 11 min ride and get yourself to this fantastic little Italian restaurant. We had grilled octopus - done to PERFECTION.  Then I had one of the absolute BEST Pasta Carbonaras I have had outside of Rome. Beautiful Sangovese by the bottle that we could ACTUALLY afford. When I was asked for the dressing for my artichoke salad, I was surprised. The waiter started offering dressings, "" ranch, italian, ..."" I said oil, vinegar; he said, ""ah the regular."" YES , I exclaimed. Perfect fresh blend of oil, red wine vinegar and herbs. Beautiful. Everything was delicioso! Will definitely be back. Take the ride!"
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Stephanie M.,"DUDE. Is everything here made in house?!!! I ordered delivery from this place last night, and it has been my main talking point today, because of how incredibly delicious the food was. HOLY TOLEDO. I had finally gotten home from my loooong week at work, and I didn't want to see anyone or eat healthy, or be a member of society in an capacity. I wanted to sit on my couch, watch Bridget Jones's Diary, and eat lots of carbs. I wanted pasta. I literally couldn't decide between the fettuccine alfredo or the rigattoni alla vodka for so long, that I called people to ask them to help me make my decision. I received two opposite answers between the options presented, and ended up having to call my mother to break the tie. She said the vodka sauce. I bit the bullet, and I went for it. This pasta, you guys, was FABULOUS. Perfectly cooked, and the sauce OH, MY STARS, THE SAUCE. And the ROLLS!! I am so sad that my order only has one more serving left (of course the servings were too big). I have to go here in person, because outside of Italy, this may very well be the best Italian food that I've had. Do yourselves a favor, and go to here now."
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Sid P.,"Plenty of food. Casual but clean and simple decor. You're coming here for the food and the warm, friendly service. It's a family owned place and it feels like it, every time someone drops by to check on you.

Our food was delicious. Their reputation is accurate, and no wonder they get nearly 5 stars. My tortellini soup was served in a wonderful broth that had body, with spinach that wasn't mushy or wilted like many soups will (oh, spinach, when will you stand up for yourself?). Portions were ""Chicago-sized"": easily each entree is enough for one, probably enough to take home, and certainly enough that you won't mind giving your tablemate(s) a bite so they know just how good everything served is. (I actually thought my date's pasta choice, a linguine with shrimp and vegetables in a garlicky white wine sauce, was even better than my choice.)

Everything was made with high quality ingredients and cooked perfectly. Our waitress was actually one of the owners, and of course she treated us like family (in a good way... I guess it depends on your family what that might mean otherwise). She had recommendations and knew all the dishes backwards and forwards, and she encouraged us to let her know our preferences about anything, as the kitchen can customize many aspects.

I would recommend this place to everyone. The place accommodates about 50-60 people I think, but we went early on a weekday and so they weren't crowded which meant personalized service and no rushing about. It was a delightful experience... and I look forward to going back again and again... so much so that after 10 days, I'm going again."
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Jen C.,"This is one of my husband and I's favorite Italian places in the West Town area. The rolls and the vodka sauce are the best I have ever had. The restaurant is very cute, but we usually order take out from them. Everything comes as ordered, its hot, and always delicious."
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Anthony G.,This is by far one of my favorite Italian restaurants everything u order comes out fresh an great tasting service is great very helpful on whatever u ask an Desire
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Lauren C.,"Such a disappointment.  I had reservations here to take my parents out to eat while they were in town visiting.  On a Friday night, reservations were completely unnecessary - and for good reason.  The pasta isn't fresh, the sauces aren't inspired - we would have been better off staying home and roasting a few tomatoes with the boxed pasta we have on hand.  Not a bad place, but certainly not worth a repeat.  Super forgettable in every single way."
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Laura N.,"I used Ubereats to place my order. I wrote in two places under special instructions that I wanted parmesan cheese on the side. Received food with no parmesan cheese, and I don't have any at home. 

Called to ask about parmesan cheese. First person I spoke to seemed sympathetic but placed me on hold. Second person (apparently the manager) was not sympathetic and somewhat rude, saying the food is already tossed with parm. He said parm on the side is $1.50 and to use Uber again to order it. Basically a ""let them eat cake"" non-solution. I even looked at the restaurant a second time in the Ubereats app. No where is there an option to choose a side of cheese.

Looking at the spaghetti and meatball dish, there is definitely no parm in it. Called a second time to say that the food was not tossed in parm. Got the first guy again. The best he could offer was $5 off a future order, but I would not take the chance to order again. Probably best to stick to dine-in.

Who wants to eat spaghetti NOT all covered in cheese? At least they didn't lose my poor meatball.

EDIT: I just noticed my delivery ticket had side of parmesan cheese hand written on it!"
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Ariana V.,"I LOVE at his place. My three favorites are the ceasar salad, gamberi shrimp, and the bread of course because it's FIYAH. It's a family owned business with great customer service and big portions."
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Jennifer I.,"Come for the rolls, stay for the rest.

Holy Cow, what are in those things?????????"
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Peggy T.,"My boyfriend and I live around the corner and love coming here for an Impromptu date night. It is usually quite easy to get in, and we always pick a high top table up by the front. The owners son usually serves us and he is very kind. They offer huge portions and dinner rolls to start. One of us usually gets the Chicken Parmesan and it's always delicious. Their arabiatta sauce is great but I'd hold off on the jalape√±os. Yesterday I got the tortellini with a red cream sauce and it was great! I'd suggest doing a mix of the meat and cheese tortellini... They're homemade and very tasty. I wish this place was busier as I truly think they deserve it. The service could be a little more attentive and quicker, but overall I really love this place!"
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Laurel Z.,"Cute little Italian place. Their grilled calamari was the best I've ever had!! So delicious! 

Their shrimp and mushroom pasta was also pretty amazing! A huge portion though, as expected with most Italian places. 

This place is kind of a hidden gem but they do seafood very well!"
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Kelly D.,"Absolutely outstanding! Food was the best Italian I've EVER had. The Carbonara was incredible! Pretty ambiance, friendly waitstaff. A must try!"
oggi-trattoria-chicago-2,Jessica S.,"Good food, good people,  simple atmosphere.  I went and enjoyed what I had and will be back."
eden-chicago-4,Claudia D.,"Matt gave professional, knowledgeable, friendly  service. The staff worked together splendidly to make our dinner lovely.
The ambience is peaceful and beautiful.
The food is delicious. The special olive bread made by the pastry chef in-house with sides of house-churned butter and extra virgin olive oil is not to be missed.
We shared the beet salad. It was a beautiful presentation and every element added flavor and texture to the dish without detracting from the unique flavor of each type of beet in the dish.
The husband enjoyed the lamb shank which was decorated with micro greens and pomegranate arils.
I enjoyed every morsel of the lentil brik. It was a bit salty, but the flavors and textures enhanced each other. I highly recommend the brik and the beet salad.
I enjoyed the hazelnut dessert. It was layered gelato, cookie, chocolate and textural contrasts enhanced the dish. I just wish it had been a larger portion.
Overall, a touch dear for a weekly visit, but we plan to return.
Free parking in the private lot which is well lit.
Specials available Tuesday through Thursday.
Overall, I recommend Eden for a special occasion."
eden-chicago-4,Jacko J.,"The good

- Space is beautifully done
- People working there seem friendly
- On paper the menu looks great

The not so good

- Many of the dishes are not well balanced. Two of the appetizers (brussels +  sunchokes) were too acidic and the tortellini was too sweet. Steak was cold by the time it arrived (more on this below). 

- Food took forever to come out and when it arrived it was cold. It took over 30 minutes for our mains and they arrived at separate times. No explanation/apology provided.

- For the price, the above is inexcusable"
eden-chicago-4,Michelle T.,"5 Star introduction for my first visit to Eden! First, allow me to chronicle a back story. I've been going through a quarter life crisis so, I was on the prowl for a meal to gift myself as a farewell to my 20's. I was looking for something I could enjoy on my own and naturally transfer my sorrows into food. Too depressing for this review! Done!  

I came across Eden's Chef's Counter Menu. Five courses for the price of a mani-pedi (opted for no wine pairings). Eden is not on restaurant row and I second guessed the GPS when it directed me opposite. Approaching, I thought, ""Oh no I don't feel comfortable leaving my car under the tracks in this neck of the woods."" Thankfully, Eden has a brightly light parking lot! From the lot, you can see the row of tents that house a harvest of home grown vegetables! 

I was welcomed by the host with complimentary coat check. There were only three tables of people in the restaurant (more people came later in the evening). I knew this would give way for an intimate experience. I pulled up to the Chef's Counter with a birds eye view of all the action. Servers Josh and Mitch couldn't have been more welcoming and friendly. They made service top notch, replacing dinnerware, refilling tea instantaneously, and made conversation with me. 

5 Courses were: (full list of ingredients are depicted in the picture of the menu.) 
-Roasted Sunchokes- presented by server. This was excellent. Tied for first for favorites. The small portion was hearty and crispy. 

-Ahi Tuna Crudo - presented by the server. This was excellent. I loved the complexity of this dish. This dish had the most gourmet feel to it with the different piped mouses and textures on the plate all complimenting the tuna. A little crunch as well.

-Chestnut Tortellini - presented by Sous Chef. This pasta dish topped with freshly grated parm was very good but didn't stand out among the rest of the items. I did love the cashew texture. 

-Carta Fata Sea Bass - present by Sous Chef is the show stopper dish and another favorite. Carta Fata is a cooking technique that uses a sealed transparent pouch. This was presented still pinned then Chef opened the bag releasing steam and the most aromatic smell! I couldn't wait to dig in! Stew-like, best eaten with a spoon as to divulge in all of the flavorful broth! Excellent!

-Black Chocolate - presented by Pastry Chef Stefano Tulipano. If you like that show Zumbo's Just Desserts on Netflix, it was like the moments when the contestants present their desserts to Zumbo describing their dish. Only, all my brain could comprehend was, ""chocolate."" Chocolate every other word! Woohoo! Yup, just like that for a fabulous ending. 

Overall, coming into this experience I knew I was going to receive smaller portions than normal and that it wasn't going to be Michelin star rated. I was totally ok with that, however, I'm not sure the items on the tasting menu are for everyone because the fare was light. Filling for me, but others might not be full by the end. I would recommend sticking to the normal menu if it's your first time visiting. Go for any of the protein dishes. Server Mitch was kind enough to show me all the plates that were coming out of the kitchen and let me tell you everything looked plentiful and mouthwatering especially: bone marrow, chicken, steak, and cauliflower crepes. Presentation is phenomenal here and ten times larger than my tasting plates! lol If you want to really splurge, do the tasting menu along with regular menu items. 

P.S. Special shout out to both Chefs who took good care of me. Chef Stefano, is bubbly and infectiously happy in nature! Chef Bryan is as cool as a cucumber, he even had everyone sign my menu to take home! How sweet! These guys are the real deal and it's so reassuring because their genuine hospitality makes this restaurant far from pretentious. What I loved most is, the amount and variety of vegetables used in all dishes. This made for an untainted, pure, clean eating experience. Can't wait to return!"
eden-chicago-4,Mary D.,"My friend and I went here for restaurant week and had a fun girls night out! It's nice to have a high quality dining establishment right near the United Center. I loved the ambiance, it has a modern feel. The service was friendly and prompt. In terms of the food, it was very good in general but there were a couple things I didn't enjoy as much. The cauliflower appetizer was excellent and well seasoned. The lentil brik entree was tasty but the flavors were a little disjointed bc there's so much on the plate. The Apple cake dessert was my least favorite, I enjoyed the cake but both my friend and I avoided eating some of the spices on top bc they were pretty bitter and didn't work for a dessert. I will probably just come here again for cocktails but enjoyed trying dinner."
eden-chicago-4,Rebecca M.,"A delicious take on mediterranean/american food!

We came here for NYE, so the place was pretty packed. Luckily there were seats at the bar where we could wait and enjoy their cocktails and admire the decor- I loved the industrial/hipster/clean vibe they have there! 

The food was on par with how beautiful the restaurant was. I got to try the lamb and beef meatballs, chicken, and steak, and all were amazing. This is one of those places where I didn't know what half the ingredients were on the menu, but everything just came together perfectly! 

I highly recommend the chicken and gnocchi-- the chicken was cooked beautifully (not dry at all, which is my biggest fear when ordering chicken at a restaurant) and all the flavors worked really well together!

We ended the night with dessert (Black Chocolate- interesting... pretty good but mostly interesting) and a champagne toast to welcome in the new year :)"
eden-chicago-4,Michael B.,"Anytime I debate to myself whether or not to write a review because it's so good I don't want the mobs to ruin it you know it's a great find and fabulous experience. So, out of respect for the talented culinary team, delightful servers and beautiful apiece, I must post a review despite my selfish tendencies. 

Went for brunch with my Yelp Idol Yvonne B and crew and Love everything about it!! Gorgeous warm chic stylish industrial interior. Terrific friendly switched on people working there and the food...boom! 

Interesting dishes, expertly prepared. My sweet potato pork belly hash was one of the best breakfasts I've had in recent memory.

They definitely have a big pork belly thing going on there, but you know what, it's fabulous and seems to comes on or as a side option for everything.  

Parking lot and easy street parking. Can't wait to go back for brunch and dinner."
eden-chicago-4,Jennifer S.,"I came here for Valentine's Day and O-M-G. This place was very busy. The food is somewhat greek inspired. The decor is simple, elegant but beautiful. I ordered the ""elevenses"" drink. I'm a lavender lover and this was delicious and not sweet! We started off with the lamb meatballs which were melt in our mouth delicious. The beet salad followed and that was refreshing and tasty. My entree was the octopus and it was the BEST THING EVER. It was somewhat of a stew and came with some bread. The bread was a cross between naan and pita. It was fluffy and grilled. The stew also has mussels and some other pieces of fish. The flavor was beyond anything I've ever tasted before."
eden-chicago-4,Cassandra A.,"Came last night for date night and was totally blown away. If I have to be critical, it's really 4.8 stars due to some salty dishes. However the ambiance is really cool (check out the first couple pages of the bar menu for an explanation of how every decoration was handpicked for a reason) and the service was outstanding. My water was rarely empty, and our server William was delightful and very helpful. Also the hosts were particularly cheery and fun which is unique because I normally don't remember much about the hosts (no offense! I was a host once too!). I had prosecco and David had Fernetflix & Chill which is not only a cool-Ass drink name but also one of the most complex drinks I've ever tried - peppermint meets savory...just order it! 
The food:

Carrots: yummmm! Smaller dish but lots of flavors. I love carrots and knew I wanted to order this immediately. Less healthy than I was aiming for because it has a lot going on there but I had no ragrets

Octopus: this one was delicious BUT salty. I enjoyed the corn and the lettuce in addition to the deliciously cooked octopus. I think the waiter said the octopus was sous-vide and then cooked on wood grill and the flavor showed! I just wish it was a hair less salty - then again I am super sensitive to salt...

Salmon croquettes: bomb! Loved them. I expected to crack them open to flaky salmon but that wasn't how it was - it was more like the salmon was built into the filling so when you ate it, you tasted salmon but had a normal bread-like or muffin-like texture. I loved the peppers and sauce accompanying it too.

Cumin lamb: guys, I don't even like red meat and I liked this! The meat was SO tender and not fatty. The patties that came were also great quality - felt like I was in an authentic Greek restaurant for a moment!

Seafood stew: this one was very salty :( bummer because I love seafood and I love stews and I love flatbread so I was pumped for it but ate very little. It's a hefty portion so I definitely recommend sharing. Mussels were delicious and our market fish was sea bass I believe which was flaky and perf. So basically this dish was a 3.5/4 ONLY because of the salt.

Green beans: yummy, but nothing special. Save the money and stomach space for something cooler on the menu. I just wanted more veggies in my life so had to get it. Next time I'd swap this for the beet salad since I love beets.

I'd LOVE to return for brunch. William said it's phenomenal and I believe him because he's William and he's the shit. Thanks for a great night, Eden!"
eden-chicago-4,Otto V.,"The service was excellent, the food not so much. It is not for me. 

The decor has a subtle modern sophistication¬† with white wash, brick exposed walls and very little wall decorations.

The stainless steel covered tables mix well with the walls & the soft indirect lighting adds elegance to the place.

We were the first customers of the evening during this visit.

The menu indicates American Mediterranean style, and shows the chef's dedicated imagination to his craft.

The appetizers (Starters), and the small plates (First Course) are not bad, but did not wow me, or blow me away. 

From the Starters, The Umami Doughnuts are a popular choice, but The lamb and Beef Meatballs get my vote as a better choice.

From the First Course, I'm partial to the Salmon Crudo, but, my date stands firm for the Grilled Baby Octopus.

The main course is where I was completely disappointed.

Maybe it is me, but when I ordered the Seafood Stew, I was expecting something like a Boullanese or a Chopino, or even a Greek Fisherman's Stew; instead, what I got was a good flavored, well reduced stock and very little else.

I originally intended to order the ""Cumin Grilled Lamb"", but it is served with couscous, which I don't particularly enjoy, and when I asked if it could be substituted by anything else, I was told I could order another side dish. (No substitutes)

By the way, the menu indicated ""grilled baguette"" with the seafood stew, but it was substituted with something like pita or flat bread. (So much for no substitutes).

I guess if I were to go back, or recommend someone to do so, it will be for wine, drinks & small plates. Ease yourself into it, maybe you will like it better then I did; after all, it's all a matter of taste."
eden-chicago-4,Carol K.,"Eden?  Is that your name?  Is that because you are a little garden of indulgence located in an unassuming area on the near west side?  Is it because your food, drink and service make you feel that you have entered a slice of food paradise? Whatever the reason for your name, this restaurant, open about a year at this writing, blew my friends and I away the other night with a perfect trifecta of food, service and drink.

We had a group of 8 so when I made the reservation, it showed up that they only had a high top left.  Hmm . . . .I'm a girl who likes to dine with her feet on the ground but I thought I would give it a shot and it worked out perfectly.  Know that this cute interior has a mix of tables, hightops and seats at the bar.  The interior is crisp and cool so don't let the stern facade faze you.  This restaurant takes up the corner of Paramount Events so the great news here is there is a LARGE parking lot for those of you who question whether this is a great place to leave your car on the street.  A minute on the neighborhood- it's a bit off the beaten path today but I suspect in a few years the hot west loop mania will be taking over here too.  This would be a great place to go prior to some event at the United Center given it's close proximity.

Now on to the real stars of the show- the service and the food.  First on service- Cindy was our server extrodinaire and she rocked our entire evening.  She's the kind of server you'd like as your best friend, offering up suggestions, finding things for us to try that weren't even on the menu and keeping the food and drink pacing spot on which was no small feat given the size and opinions of our group!  I'd go back again just to see this serving maven even if the food wasn't as good as it was.

Ahhhh . . . .the food!  Where do I start for every course was better than the one before it?  Given we had a large group- we just ordered a little of this and that so in the end, we tried most of the menu.  Here are our favorites:  for starters the meatballs, mushroom and pork donuts (sounds odd but order them, they are great!) and the carpaccio (spicy . . what gave it that kick? so good and beautifully presented!)

For entrees- they were all winners, the pork chop was huge and perfectly cooked, the steak tender and juicy, the lentil brick (sounds odd but was delish for a veggie offering) and the chicken which was stuffed with more chicken (if you are one who never orders chicken when you go out- you must try this!)

And then it that wasn't enough- there were desserts, chocolate chip cookies hidden in a glass covered with chocolate, a chocolate cake with a mousse like filling served with charcoal ice cream, an upside down apple cake,and my favorite the strawberry shortcake which was as beautiful to behold as it was to eat!

The wine was amazing and we even got a little upgrade to a better bottle.  And if specialty cocktails are your thing- they've got those too.  

I could go on and on but instead of doing so, just go and check it out for yourself.  There is no doubt you will be raving about this special ""garden of indulgences"" too.  That's just the way Eden does it!"
eden-chicago-4,Teresa C.,"Came here on Valentines Day and had one of their two price fix menus. Overall, the food was all very good, with the exception that the short rib was a bit dry. The service on the other hand was very slow. We waited around 30 minutes before getting any of our curses aside from the amuse-bouche. Our server was nice and apologized for the delay, but especially for a tasting menu, there should never be that long of a wait. I'll probably give it another shot since the food was good and hope for quicker service."
eden-chicago-4,Breanna B.,"Loved the meal here! We came for a group dinner and had a menu set for the evening. It was nice to have a couple options to choose from. I think I went with the right choices, for sure. The squash caponata was out of this world as was the hominy-legume stew. Each dish provided a mix of creative ingredient combinations and flavor profiles that I rarely experience at restaurants, which was refreshing. 

The space itself is beautiful. Upscale rustic vibes with white ceiling and walls, brick accents and wood floors. 

Everything about our experience that evening was comfortable and well executed. Cocktails are a must! The servers are all wonderfully accommodating too."
eden-chicago-4,H M.,"My daughter says I speak in hyperboles (and I DO) but this review is so worthy of my accolades - please believe me!    Hands-down one of the finest meals I've had in Chicago (I've lived here 30 years).   
This is a cool spot in funky - I don't know the official name of the neighborhood.  west West Town?   

The space is beautiful: lots of white, grey and muted lighting.    Several areas in which to dine (tables, bar, and the ""chef's area"" - which is an 8- seat counter along the kitchen where you can watch the action).  

The food is beautifully presented - I thought I might be at a lovely restaurant in Napa Valley.   (I'm wondering if Owner /chef Devon might have trained at the French Laundry or somewhere in France?)
We started with lamb & beef meatballs and the in-house cured carpaccio for appetizers.    We then shared the chicken Ballotine (a classic French preparation) and the glazed carrots.      Everything has a slight Mediterranean spice touch.  

If you're a true oenophile they also offer some amazing red wines by the glass (Harlan, Joseph Phelps) which is another rarity. 

I felt the prices were very reasonable considering the complexity of the dishes.     the staff and service is top-notch.  I can't remember a friendlier, more gracious staff - from hostess, to waitstaff,  to chef.

Highly recommend!"
eden-chicago-4,Gula L.,"Eden, a fresh take on mediterranean and american food, edeninchicago.com says. This may be true for their dinner menu, unfortunately for the sunday brunch goer this is patently false. Harsh? Yes. Truthful? Absolutely. 

Before jumping into the the negatives, that you schadenfreude seeking folk crave, I must, MUST confess an unrelenting love for their AMAZING hot chocolate. Its pleasant sweetness and delightful taste single handedly changed a 1.5 star experience into a solid 3 stars. I'd return just to sip that sweet nectar once more. 

I hope the management uses the feedback as an opportunity to improve. 

The older gentleman who was our server, initially made a wonderful impression with his passion and knowledge of the menu. We were all primed to believe our elder, he claimed that the burger is ""The best in America"" straining credibility, but we heard nothing but great things. So perhaps, this would be an experience worthy of a memory. The strong endorsement from such a nice fellow, one poor member of our group ordered the burger. It came with slightly charred (read:burned) english muffin bun, which was quickly replaced upon complaining, but the damage was done. The blame lays less in the burger but in how it was sold...ahem...oversold. The meat patty wasn't a thick as he said it was or truthfully as delicious. It was a fine burger, but greatest burger it was not. Sorry, not sorry. 

The waiter proceeded to talk how the Panettone takes 3 days to make and it is ""only"" $25 dollars vs. the far more expensive $50 option at Treasure Island. First of all, when someone goes to a restaurant such as Eden, the talk of money is, well a bit uncouth. I'm not here to save a few bucks, I'm here to set my damn taste buds on fire with delight. Let's not be coarse and discuss financial matters. Kapish?

Our party, also had the benefit of trying the breakfast bowl, which was quite a meal, but a lot heavier than you'd expect. Very filling, with a tad too much rice. I'd prefer a lighter fare, but that's just personal preference. 

To end on a high note, I'd like to compliment the metric coffee which was well balanced.

3 stars, do come and try. Come to think of, if our waiter didn't set our expectations sky high we probably would've left with a much more positive impression. Oh well, hope you all enjoyed the read."
eden-chicago-4,Stephanie L.,"It's really a 3.5 but no halves on Yelp!

Went on a Saturday night with two other couples.  It was pretty busy in the place.  Also very loud!  If you don't like noise, don't dine here.  It's like the voices echo off everything.  We didn't mind.

The service started off good but slowly took a turn for the worst.  We ordered some apps, then pasta, then entrees.  We were absolutely bombarded by about 7-8 dishes.  We had told them to hold off on the pasta, but it was brought anyway.  They completely forgot the umami donuts and after we were done eating, they asked if we still wanted them.  Lol.  
We put a hold on our entrees as we shifted plates and felt rushed to shovel in the apps and pasta to make room.  I think there was a party going on either outside or somewhere.  They were struggling and I saw a large tent outside.

The drinks were very unimpressive.  After my first cocktail we decided that wine would be a better option.  Everyone at our table was kind of luke warm with the cocktails.  Even at the end of the meal, we wanted one more drink and instead of ordering it here, we packed up and headed to Maudes.

The food was actually pretty good!
I love the concept of garden/fresh, etc
House made bread-one came out with an herb butter and then later when we ordered more, plain butter.  But it was good.  Nothing too amazing 
Lamb & beef meatballs-excellent.  The freshness of the herbs cane through.  
Wedge salad-great.  I just wished there was a little more dressing to soak up the lettuce leaves
Octopus-yum!  Refreshing and cooked to perfection.  The zip of lemon and chicory yogurt really balanced it out.
Pierogi-I really enjoyed this.  The sauce was very earthy.  The pierogi were pillows of soft dough that melted in my mouth
Tagliatelle-rich and creamy with just the right amount of meat.  Again, pasta was amazingly done
Seafood stew-excellent!  Slightly spicy.  Mounds of mussels and fish filled my bowl.  So good

Overall, the food was pretty darn good.  Worth a trip BUT our experience was ruined by the mediocre cocktails and the poor service."
eden-chicago-4,Teri Y.,"Eden was outstanding, really. We arrived on a Friday evening, and most (but not all) tables were filled. We made a reso on OpenTable and opted for the bar seating beforehand, and the hostess offered us the kitchen counter seating. Well that was a bonus. 

Ample natural sunlight flowed into the industrial loft-like space. White subway tiles against the kitchen wall. White exposed bricks. Wooden floor panels (reclaimed wood maybe). Every dish we ordered was on point in terms of taste and presentation. If Eden wasn't off the beaten path of the West Loop-ish area, if it was on Randolph or Fulton Market, I bet it would be harder to score reservations here.

Beef & lamb meatballs -- so flavorful with the perfect level of moist.

Ahi tuna crudo -- one of the memorable items for me. Give the egg yolk a little poke and the runny yolk flows out to the chunks of very fresh rare tuna.

Pork tagliatelle -- oh my goodness. Really could not get enough of this. The pasta had the perfect chewy texture and the sauce was so well flavored. The addition of nuts and apples may sound odd but came together nicely before we moved on to the remaining final courses.

Seafood stew -- dare I say the best I've had? One of the reasons is that it isn't your generic tomato-based seafood stew that seemed to be the most common way of preparing it at every other restaurant. The broth had so much depth. The flavor was complex but without any heaviness. We learnt from Chef Devon that andouille was used as the base of the broth (hopefully I remembered that right). Additional items go into the making the broth, including octopus.

Bavette steak -- it was good, though admittedly we were a little less excited about this dish than the others.

Overall really such a great place and looking forward to returning for brunch service."
eden-chicago-4,Rishi J.,"This is a hard restaurant to review; there was so much good, but I feel like the couple things that were bad were pretty important.

The decor is beautiful...to me, it has this modern, room and board vibe -- its contemporary, but feels like home.

The first thing you really notice, however, is the noise.  If you intend on making this a date or a family/friends thing where you want to hear each other, its hard to want to be here.

The hostesses and staff there the evening I went were (Jan. 19), however, top notch -- they took our coats, and offered us a private room when we asked, as a high top would be tough on my parents.  

I thought the menu was great, and the food was really tasty, but there were two big problems.  First, the food was slow to arrive -- our server apologized, but it took a pretty long while for drinks to arrive, and then appetizers, and then the main courses.  So long in fact, that it brings me to #2 -- the food was pretty cold.  the steak was cold, the otherwise delicious lobster gnocchi was cold, etc. etc. It was still good, but put a damper on an otherwise wonderful experience.  

I want to stress this again, however, the service for the most part was really great (our server, when we asked to explain what we were eating, wasn't very, i don't know, ""polished"" about the description? and he kept pointing really really close to the plate, like he was going to touch the food....maybe I'm crazy).  

The staff was nice, informative, and just awesome.  I just hope this place can work out some of the logistical kinks."

eden-chicago-4,Brianna O.,"Staff is fantastic. Food is AMAZING!!!
I highly recommend this restaurant."
eden-chicago-4,Michelangelo V.,"Honest review: amaizin really pretty looking restaurant the owner is so nice!!! The service besides our waiter was amaizin really kind n helpful. Service: Worst waiter i ever had n i have had some shitty waiters. besides her this place was amaizin must orders: foie gras/ uni pork belly/ bone marrow/ lasagna/ market fish/ lamb/ donuts/ chocolate crunch/ apple namelaka
Umami donut $8 the donut texture was really fluffy. The filling was really tender just wish it was more flavorful. The coating on the donut was a bunch of savory powders that get stuck on ur finger so dont eat with ur hands. The sauce was really rich just wish there was more cheese in it. this dish was good just not as amaizing as everything else add something to make it up like put truffle in the cheese sauce make the filling more rich add something spicy n vinegary to give it pop

Seared foiegras 24$ amaizin: the foiegras was seared perfectly it melted in ur mouth. Its pared with a blackberry componte thats sweet pairs beutifully with foiegras cuts down the richness. Only thing would have preferred sauce over a compote. The bread was nice n butter an toasted so good. If i had any complaints jus something acidic n spicy would have gave it pop but loved it

Roasted baby beets 11$: ask for more sauce didnt really care for this wasnt as amaizin as anything else there no pop to it jus a basic beet salad. 

Bone marrow 18$ one of the best bone marrows i ever had. The bone marrow was tender not over cooked the salsa verse really cut through the richness of the dish!! The slice chilis cut through the richness jus add a lil more. Love the bread wasnt burnt and was nice n oily just wish it wasn't cut into cubes kind of hard to eat. The only thing is i wish instead of turnips n radishes they used parsnips the sweetness would have been beutiful so ordering this again everything worked perfectly together.

Uni and grilled pork belly: amaizing but there was a problem the chef forgot to put uni and the passion fruit sauce told the manager n he hooked it up with a plate full of uni :) the pork belly was amaizin it was rich like steak n the texture wasnt hard or fatty. The sweetness of the onions cut through the richness only complaint other then forgetting to put ingredients is toast the bread plz bread needs to be crunchy

Duck lasagna 20$: amaizin one of the best lasagnas i ever had. This is a lasagna that has every flavor element sweet,salty, bitter, sour. Its a big portion too, there was so much duck n it was so tender and flavorful. Theres mustard greens that cut through the richness. The fried rice on top adds nice texture the citrus n the balsamic vinegar added a nice sweet and sour note to cut through the richness. I loved the sauce jus plz put more cheese i love pounds of cheese n put more fried rich for texture

Market fish (meagre) 28$: amaizin one of the best dishes of the night. The fish was cooked perfectly with crispy skin. The chestnut puree is to die for n it goes great with the fish not overpowering it. Its paired with a rich grain thats really tasty then sauerkraut thats not to acidic that cut through the richness i would come just for this

Lamb 36: amaizin. The lamb was amaizin big portion supper tender and flavorful. The panna cotta didnt set but it was so tasty theres mint in it and lamb goes great with mint jus put more cause not enough it really cuts through the richness. Theirs a lamb jus on the plate really tasty just would prefer a thicker sauce over a soupy one. The chickpea stew its like whole chickpeas n humus was amaizin phenomenal i didnt share this dish only complaint is needs texture u could fry up some chickpeas its worth the price

Donuts: amaizin the donuts were really tasty just the texture was off maybe a lil underdone n add more 3 donuts is not enough! The salted carmel was amaizin cut through the sweetness. Loved the icecream perfect texture just wish it was something unique something acidic to cut through the richness would have been great. Then theirs frozen chocolate n a chocolate sauce really good jus put some cayenne to give it some pop good dessert jus needs some wow factor 

Chocolate crunch $8:(its like a chocolate frozen icecream cake) amaizin: the cake is supper moist not to sweet. The icecream is tasty not bitter.the brittle was amaizin adding great texture. the fruit sauce adds great freshness n some acidity to cut through the richness. My only complaint is put some cayanne coffee or sea salt in the chocolate to give it some pop

Pear: good not great. The pears poached perfectly so its not crunchy. The problem was that it needs more texture add some candied nuts n some cake. I liked it jus need more texture

Apple namelaka: best dessert of the night. The olive oil cake was the perfect combination of sweet and savory only complaint make cake moister n do something with cubed apples

Chocolate: to bitter add seasalt,cayenne, or something sour to counter act bitterness"
mod-mex-and-mod-mix-with-rick-bayless-chicago-2,Candice G.,"I'm no Chef and it'd be a cold day in hell before anyone considered me a 'foodie' but I'll be damned if I'm going to turn down the opportunity to attend what I know to be Chicago's best kept (practically) secret culinary event. 

This was my second year attending this astoundingly intimate educational course and tasting event hosted by Rick Bayless himself with help from a handful of renowned Chefs that changes each year from Mexico, NYC, and Chicago as back-up. 

The once a year event takes place at Kendall College and utilizes one of their extraordinary demo classrooms with auditorium-style seating, as well as a large banquet area where post-demos you get to taste all of the demo recipes and drink yourself silly with some very strong and very scientific cocktails. 

My Dad is a big Bayless fan, so he does all the legwork to secure tickets to this event, which are unbelievably nominal for an event of this caliber, which runs a full 8-hours from breakfast, to demos, to tasting, to Q&A and only holds somewhere between 75-100 people with everyone leaving with comfortably full stomachs and a delightful buzz (and then some) from the booze. 

The basic concept of the event is simple: ""Four chefs. Four styles. One cuisine. At this friendly face-off, each chef defends his vision of Mexican cooking while the event emcee referees. Includes food, beverages, cooking demonstrations, tastings of tequila, wines and more!""

As previously noted, I'm no Chef. I'm often scrutinized as the worst cook in the world, constantly have my everyday diet compared to that of an 8-year-old boy, and since living on my own I'd estimate that on average I consistently give myself food poisoning 4.5 times a week. In a few years I will have developed either the foremost or most fragile immune system in North America.  

This information is relevant because even though I have no interest and get no joy from cooking, I always manage to stay glued to the presenters, techniques, anecdotal stories, and of course the food and beverage prepared by each of the Chefs, Mixologists, and brands represented at the event. This event appeals to all.

In addition to getting to learn a thing or two and eat and drinks all the goodies, you get meet all the Chefs and moving parts involved, take pics, and in some cases you're even personally served by the Chef himself, which is an honor that none should take lightly. 

The cost of the event is almost unbelievable. The first I'd guess around 75-80 people were there for the demos through to the tastings and I was told that was the sold out event. This year, shockingly, the event didn't sell out and when the demos began that morning there were maybe 60 people there, all getting this one-on-one face time with every Chef and vendor. The cost of the event the first year was (are you sitting down? Because you aren't going to believe me when I tell you).... $75 a person. The cost this year was slightly elevated at $95 a person, but still grossly below market value given the full day of demos, world-class food, drinks, and getting to meet culinary genius' at work in an intimate and relaxed environment. 
(and I'll be real, I never wrote a review of this before because I wanted to be sure I could secure a ticket for myself in the following years, and only now that I've moved out of state do I feel comfortable enough to share this opportunity to the masses... or like maybe 4 people who glance at my writes. 

The first year's event was nothing short of spectacular and yet they still found ways to improve and blow it out of the water with this year's event, this time emceed my WGN's Ana Belaval, who was a great addition and obviously impressed Chef Bayless to almost beyond words with her seamless segues and constant but warranted stream of comments, questions, and general banter. I wouldn't be surprised if she became a constant for this event in the future given the level she took the event to in 2014.

The 2013 line-up was as follows...
Rick Bayless (Frontera, Chicago)
Alex Stupak (Empell√≥n, NYC)
Carlos Gaytan (Mexique, Chicago)
Jorge Vallejo (Quintonil, Mexico City)
Emcee: Peter Sagal, of NPR's Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!
Jordan Johnston (Frontera mixologist, Chicago)
Wahaka Espadin Joven mezcal
Wines of Mexico

The 2014 line-up was as follows...
Rick Bayless
Curtis Duffy (Grace - Chicago)
Fany Gerson (La Newyorkina, NYC)
Pablo Salas (Amaranta Restaurant, Mexico City) 
Dave Arnold (Booker and Dax -cocktails, NYC)
Joseph Mortera (Cocktail developer, Mexico City)
Jay Schroeder (Frontera mixologist, Chicago)   
Emcee  Ana Belaval, of WGN

The caliber of this annual event is nothing short of impeccable, full of moments made into memories with a robust cast of colorful culinary characters and priced so modestly that I felt it totally reasonable to fly back to Chicago from San Francisco for the weekend, just to attend this event. Worth every penny, plane, train, and automobile it took to get to Mod Mex with Rick Bayless."
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Lisa P.,"One of my favorite Chicago restaurants!

I have been here quite a few times and each time the service and food are just as excellent, if not better than the last time. My favorite items on the menu are the lamb meatballs, the beet salad, the watermelon salad when it's in season, and the salsiccia pizza. You can't really go wrong with anything on the menu however. The ambiance of this place is also amazing. It has such a homely vibe to it. Overall, this place is amazing and I highly recommend giving it a try!"
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Patrick R.,"TL;DR: 4/5 for food, 1/5 for service.

Went there with my wife and young son for a quick dinner, early evening. We were sat almost immediately. We had no menus until the waiter came by our table about ten minutes after we sat. We ordered ten minutes after that when the waiter remembered that we existed. Beer that was ordered didn't arrive for over 20 minutes and only after we asked the hostess guy where it was. Table next to us ordered multiple salads and pizzas after we ordered and their food arrived before our two pizzas did. We had to ask the hostess guy about our pizzas after this because our waiter never came back to our table after taking he initial order despite stopping at the table next to ours. Food finally arrived over an hour after we sat down, over 45 minutes after we ordered. Pizza was very good but not worth waiting close to an hour for. If you go, just sit at the bar and don't bother with the ghost waiters."
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Meghan M.,Uhhhjhhz. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz zzGreat time and really love me a little rolling on the call go with them
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Kelsey S.,"I liked the feel of the inside here. Lots of exposed brick and a big wood fired oven. The service and food were just ok though. Got the lamb meatballs and the sauce was kind of thin. We also got a pizza and it just wasn't very flavorful. The waiter was good, but service was full despite the place being half empty."
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Lydia F.,"The best wood fire pizza in Chicago. Their pizza is addictive. We had 3 pizzas for dinner. They were delicious. We had Soppressata, pork belly and prosciutto pizza. The bar tender Jonathan was very attentive and we didn't wait for long for the pizza. Great pizza great service. Highly recommended."
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Christian M.,"I had just moved to the area so I was scoping out pizza places on Yelp and found this (only a block from my apartment).  I'm a big fan of neapolitan pizza since my home town has an amazing place that I love very much (Elio Pizza on Fire in Addison, IL).

I ordered the spinaci pizze and the rigatoni for take out.  I received my order very quickly upon coming in!  

For the pizza, I really liked the freshness of the ingredients and the crust had a good level of crunch (so not too crispy, or not too mushy).  It would have been nice to get a little more of all ingredients on the pizza, especially the tomato sauce, but it was still tasty.  Unfortunately, Elio still beats this place easily, BUT Sono Wood Fired seems to be the only place in the area that makes neapolitan pizza and I enjoyed the pizza enough to happily come back here to try the same and different pizzas.  I really liked that I could taste the garlic and since I love goat cheese and spinach, this pizza made total sense!  

The rigatoni actually impressed me more than I expected!  The pasta was al dente, just the way I like it and how it should be.  The spicy sausage and the fior de latte made this stand out even more!  There was a lot of great flavor and I liked the addition of leeks to this dish for color and taste.  The ingredients for this also tasted so fresh and I would order this again without thinking!  I also enjoyed the fact that this wasn't over saturated in sauce; it had the right amount.

Since this place is basically next door, I know that I'll have countless opportunities to try out more items on the menu!  I like this restaurant and can't wait to try other italian and/or pizza restaurants in the area so I can start to make more meaningful comparisons in my reviews!"
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Janine K.,Mussels were cooked to perfection. Half price bottles of wine on Sunday's. Waiter had great recommendations & they did not disappoint. Definitely would recommend.
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Allison T.,"This is a nice, casual spot in the neighborhood! The Arancini balls were tasty!  I would definitely recommend as a starter. Pizzas were light and good."
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Aswathi C.,"First of all- excellent service.. really good waiter who guided us through the menu extremely well and brought each item one by one.. The wood-roasted beet salad with arugula just vanished from the plate.. the yummiest salad we have tasted.. My husband loved his cocktail.. bruschette, mozzarella and the chocolate cake dessert with caramel gelato on top was amazing.. need to try some of their other pizzas and pastas next time!"
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Sajan S.,"Great for large groups! Went here with a party of 14 and they were accommodating in terms of seating and splitting checks.

For the vegetarians, I had:

Roasted pepper bruschetta (goat cheese was amazing), burrata bruschetta, wood fired beets salad (very tasty), bufalina pizza and burrata pizza.

The burrata pizza was amazing! Basil pesto and burrata was a great combo. The pizzas are 14 inches but are thin crust so feels light. If you're hungry you can easily eat the whole thing! We split all those items across 3 hungry people and were satisfied. In the future, I would get the spinaci instead of the bufalina (friends for it and it was also amazing)"
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Ashley F.,"I have been very pleased with Sono the two times I have been. It's is cozy, bright and spacious on the inside. Their pizzas are delicious and the crust is to die for. 

I would also recommend brunch. They have a smoke salmon pizza!"
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,John G.,"The Pizza is quality, but not amazing.... the service and ambiance is great. We had one of the sausage pizzas and it could use a little more meat and the Margarita pizza was just ok."
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Bear R.,"At these prices, I really expected legit, grade A, wood fired pizza. It was alright. It was good, don't get me wrong, but each slice of the Salscicca (sausage) had most of the toppings falling off when picking up.

The burrata was good, the brussel sprouts were good, but nothing was AMAZING, just A-OK, just like the 3 stars on Yelp are meant to be.

Don't think we'll be coming back anytime soon. Disappointed that this is the most prominent wood fired pizza here in Chicago."
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Karolina T.,"I've been here once before but my boyfriend was looking for an Italian spot that would play the Dayton game for him Friday evening. They have a pretty large bar but only one tv which was fine.  In the back is their brick oven and you can totally smell all the pizzas. Anyways we decided to go halvies on everything. To start we split the arugula and spinach salad. It was light and had a citrusy vinegarette. Then we had the fungi and cipollino bruschetta. I really liked the fungi but wasn't a fan of the cipollino because I don't like goat cheese. Then we split the gnocchi in vodka sauce.  The gnocchi were super soft and melt in your mouth so it was my favorite thing we had. To end, we got the pistachio and hazelnut gelato. The flavors were really good and creamy but the hazelnut gelato texture was probably the most unpleasant I've ever had!  It tasted like ice cream mixed with finely ground sand and was very off putting. Other than that I really enjoyed the food and they seem to have good weekday specials so we would consider coming back."
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,William N.,"I originally came to hang out with friends I haven't met in a while. The decor inside is really nice it wasn't loud so being able to conversate with one another was easy. 

The pizza on the other hand were decent portions and intersting toppings on each that gave them nice taste. But it's a bit pricey. On the other hand the drink list is nice they have some wine and nice beer choices. 

I would say it's worth to go eat there once."
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Kait G.,"Love this place, it is a perfect neighborhood pizza joint. Good for groups, family, or a date night. Every single item I have had from here is delicious and they just started a sweet deal on Wednesdays,$20 for 4 wine tastings paired with 4 sample dishes!!! You can't go wrong here. I've had their calamari, burrata, various pizzas, and short rib ravioli. Everything was fantastic. The mussels were underwhelming but not bad by any means. 

Service has always been exceptional, fast and give great recommendations on drinks and food. If you are not a wine drinker, they also always have a good beer selection, last time they had a few 3 floyds and pipeworks choices.

This is the type of place you come back to, not just a one time stop in. Thanks Sono!"
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Paulina A.,"The place looked nice from the outside, but I left really disappointed. We went in hoping for calamari only to find out that half of their appetizers were not available for order on a Saturday night. We ended up not getting an appetizer because our choices were not available. We ordered the pizza and it was very much lacking. The crust was fine, but it seemed like there was the bare minimum of all the ingredients. There seemed to be little sauce, cheese, or toppings - definitely not worth the cost!

Our friends requested that their meatballs come out first then their entree, but the waiter messed up and brought out their appetizer when everyone was eating their entree. Their pizza was delivered later than everyone else's food. 

Overall, too expensive for the quality and service of the place."
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,James S.,"I just stopped in for something quick while waiting for an appointment at the Apple Store across the street. My waitress told me salads are the quickest, so I ordered a spinach salad, which she recommended and was as  delicious as promised. As a bonus, she also gave me some roasted brussels sprouts with pancetta, which were also delicious. I really liked the atmosphere as well, and I am looking forward to going back for a full meal."
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Antonio M.,"The food was good but some things were lacking. The Brussels sprouts hat they are adding the menu were delicious but could have used some more balsamic. Likewise the salsicia pizza had almost no red peppers. In fact, not every slice even had red peppers on them.  We also ordered the verdure Bianche pizza which was good but only had sparse crumbles of cheese and, again, could have used more balsamic. 

The atmosphere was good however the music was quite drab given the fact that it was 90s soft rock."
sono-wood-fired-chicago-2,Matt B.,"Everything was great. The manager came over a few times for some light conversation and to check in on the service and meal.  

Will definitely be back before a concert @ Joes."
bar-biscay-chicago,Emily R.,"I had the pleasure of visiting on opening night and they knocked it out of the park!
Our party of 3 had a wooden ""booth"" near the bar - very nice space w fun lighting (our booth and the place as a whole.)

The restaurant stays on point with their ties to the basque region of Spain and their cuisine and drink presentation.   I sampled something from every area of the menu minus the meat and cheese section and everything was great!   Standouts:  scallop small bite, ox tail was enough to share  for 2 and literally falls off of the bone, and the whipped/mashed potatoes are a must.  Great wine selection too!!  Prices are very reasonable.   Lively spot, all ages present, and good to go alone (@ the bar) on a date or w a group.  Service was friendly and knowledgeable. 

Definitely worth checking this place out."
bar-biscay-chicago,Kris L.,"There may be no better combination of food cultures than the mix of Spanish and French which the Pyrenees mountain Basque country between France and Spain represents. 
 
Scott & Sari Worsham are bringing Basque culture on at their second hotspot in Chicago called Bar Biscay in Noble Square. 

Check out their Sea selections of oysters, mussels and cockles which nobody offers and smoked fish for good starters. 

For an app we had the hot cheese puffs or gougeres which were amazing. For dinner standouts for us were the oxtail and duck but diners around us were very positive on the rest of the menu. 

This spot in Noble Square which offers the only Basque cuisine in town has a great new experience for locals, get into Bar Biscay."
bar-biscay-chicago,Naywri W.,"This is from the owner's of MFK Restaurant in Lincoln Park. This is a mid-end restaurant. I had the Crushed Fingerlings that are thick potato pieces and it came with Vermouth Aoili. The sauce was great not too salty or too bland. For a drink I had a glass pitcher that was called a ""Poron"" which is from the Basque Region. It had Isastegui but spelled ""Isastegi"" Cider that's from Spain. Now check this out they passed it to guests to drink out of. It was awesome! I met the owner's Sari and Scott Worsham also. The service was great!"
bar-biscay-chicago,Jonathan C.,"It's opening night and me and my best friend sit for dinner. The waiter (Michael) comes by promptly and explains the menu and concept. 

We decide to share and sample an array of plates. We start with the Roquefort cheese and cured chorizo served with mustard seeds and fresh toast. Tasty charcuterie, the chorizo was the best I've had in recent memory. 

Up next to bat was the jamon. A thin slice of cured Ibirico ham wrapped around a marinated cube of manchego, skewered with pickled mushrooms and artichokes. These bites transported me back to Spain!

Following was the muscles, served de-shelled and cold. Topped with chopped aromatic vegetables. The flavors are strong and not for feint of palate!

Our last dish was the stew. A delightful concoction of various stewing meats and vegetables and whole wheat toast to smear it on. This was my favorite dish of the night.

I can't wait to go back and try more!"
bar-biscay-chicago,maggie t.,"Sharp interior, good drinks, relaxed vibe, solid service."
bar-biscay-chicago,Stacy L.,"Really great vibe and beautiful interior. We tried a bunch of the smaller plates, but my favorites were the Smoked Mackeral and Whipped Cabrales. Yum! Fun addition to the neighborhood, we'll definitely be back."
bar-biscay-chicago,Michael D.,Great food and excellent service. I would definitely go back. This place is a great addition to West Town.
bar-biscay-chicago,Hope E.,"I went here on opening night with my parents who were visiting from NY.   It was the perfect place to go out and celebrate. The atmosphere was incredible, the food was amazing, and I loved the cocktails. (The Red Vermouth on tap was especially fun!). We ordered a bunch of starters to share and then I got the chicken which was unbelievable. I can't wait to go back with some friends and order lots more pinxtos and cocktails, or better yet do my favorite thing and start out at the bar with a glass of wine and a snack and let the night unfold through food and drinks. The space is so fun and it really hit every note: energetic, special, exceptional food and drinks, the works. I have a feeling this place is around to stay, and the neighborhood is lucky to have it!"
roti-modern-mediterranean-chicago-12,Ace M.,"New favorite lunch spot! So happy this opened at such a great location! Admittedly, I'd never been to a Roti restaurant until now- but they've officially got a new fan for life.

Tucked into the shopping mall at North Avenue & Clyborn, right near the West Elm and Best Buy. Freestanding building with ample parking in the surrounding lot. Brand new location with lots of windows- a nice, bright space and super friendly employees. Everyone was cheerful, and very helpful.

Then there's the food. Far surpassed my expectations. Same concept as my more familiar fave, Chipoltle. You pick a method (salad, rice, or sandwich) and then your protein and toppings in a fast casual bar like setting.  Had the chicken (""roti chicken"") as a sandwich as well as a falafel rice plate. The chicken was delightfully seasoned and moist- flavorful but not overly saucey, two thumbs up! The falafel tasted freshly made and had some whole chickpeas intact inside them. Rice itself was delish and we'll seasoned. Nothing bland about any of the food! 

Totally recommend the food and this location too!"
roti-modern-mediterranean-chicago-12,Kate L.,"I love Roti! Like borderline obsessed. And I'm so glad to finally have a location up in Lincoln Park! 

When I lived out-of-state, one of the things I missed most was Roti's gluten free pita. The ingredients always taste fresh, and the wrap doesn't sit heavy in your stomach afterwards. The concept is basically like Chipotle, but Mediterranean. And they're super knowledgeable about switching up gloves for allergies!

I came here the night of their soft opening and noticed so many other people had ordered the rice plates. Maybe I'll have to branch out? But until then, the steak and red pepper sauce on gluten free pita is basically heaven."
roti-modern-mediterranean-chicago-12,Abigail H.,"What do you get when you cross West Elm furnishings with fast casual food? Roti! This place is feels like a home goods store but has dynamite Mediterranean food. Full length mirrors, hanging ferns, and intimate seating arrangements abound, making the space feel like a bright sun room.

The food is fresh and high quality. Choose a sandwich wrap ($8.00), rice bed ($8.95), or salad base ($8.95- includes chopped romaine, spring lettuce, arugula, or baby spinach and kale), add a protein (chicken roti, chicken kabob, or falafel, or for an additional buck or two add spicy lamb meatballs, steak roti, or salmon kabob), then as many vegetable and sauces as you'd like. Or, you can go for a flatbread pizza: crisp flatbread topped with a variety of meat, cheese and vegetable combinations ($7.50-$8.50). 

I had the rice plate with chicken roti, garlic sauce, red s'hug, hummus, tomato and cucumber, red cabbage slaw, couscous, pickled onions, feta, cilantro ($8.95), which was very filling. The hummus and pita sides are so yummy! There's even a kids menu (chicken pita sandwich or chicken rice plate- $4.00 each). Fresh juices are blended in the store; fountain drinks and a variety of bottled waters are also available. Wine and beer coming soon!"
roti-modern-mediterranean-chicago-12,Sara S.,"Food-wise, this place isn't anything groundbreaking. But it's one of the better places to grab a quick bite if you're running errands around the shops here. Definitely better than Olive Mediterranean Grill if you're craving that cuisine!

It's set up like a Chipotle, Subway, etc. You can choose between a sandwich, plate, or salad. We both got rice plates. I had the spicy lamb meatballs, which were OK. They had a little kick to them, but nothing too crazy. Their toppings include red cabbage slaw, Jerusalem salad, roasted vegetable, hummus, couscous, and more. Overall, I was satisfied with my quick lunch before heading back out for more errands.

Another person in the restaurant got the wrap and it looked like a massive burrito."
roti-modern-mediterranean-chicago-12,Jane V.,"Went to the grand opening of the Roti modern Mediterranean at this location. I

t is located in a very busy shopping center.  The plus is that there is a parking lot but, since it is for all of the stores in the shopping center, you may have to look around for parking.

The food is very good in all Roadie locations. Their slogan is food that loves you back. Well their food is healthier than other fast food restaurants, but the pricing is okay, not great.

You have three different choices for your meal you can get a sandwich, a rice plate, or a salad.  

We usually  opt for the rice plate, it seems to have the better variety of choices especially in the sides, toppings and sauces.  We have had both the stake roadie, the chicken roti and the salmon kabob. All of these are good my favorite is the steak Roadie and the salmon kabob.

There are many different options and I suggest you try a few you can always get your sauce on the side."
roti-modern-mediterranean-chicago-12,Louie N.,"I love Roti and have been to several of their other locations.  This one is close to my job.  Good location.  Just opened so there is still that new scent in the air.  I was greeted as soon as I arrived.  Staff seem cool, friendly.  I hope this continues.   I ordered a salmon rice plate, soup & tea = $17...kinda pricey but delish though.  They have an offer if u download app u get $5 off, do it to save, not a reasonable lunch plate but better than nearby Epic Burger.  They have a competitor nearby, Olive Mediterranean.  Both are good but I like Roti better.  Place was clean, busy, a tad nosy due to customers.   Ample free parking."
roti-modern-mediterranean-chicago-12,Julie A.,"This was my first Roti experience, and I welcome them to my work neighborhood!  I had a salad with steak and a slew of veggies and sauces - this will quickly go into my rotation of lunch options!"
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Katherine J.,"I love this place. I order on grub hub and get - plantains, Mac n cheese, yucca!!!!, and the veggie patties. As a vegetarian, it's great to have a spicy, flavorful, and still veggie option!"
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Arvin H.,"Jerk Modern... you are a conundrum. You remind me of Gnash... I love you, I hate you. To be quite honest, I don't know how I feel about you. Let me explain why. 

I loved the chicken.  It was amazing. The flavors from the jerk rub were exquisite because they were bold, complex, yet not overwhelming.  You had a spice rub with savory, peppery, spicy, and earthy flavors that just intensifies and enriches the chicken. Then the chicken was itself was cooked to perfection. It was incredibly succulent and juicy, and I can't complain about the chicken at all. 

The sides... here's where it begins... utter confusion. So you get a piece of bread, coleslaw, a large hush puppy, and side of choice which I choose the corn and beans.  My coleslaw was not very crisp or refreshing.  It didn't appeal to me at all, and I love coleslaw, so I was disappointed. Bread was bread, nothing special.  The hush puppy... phenomenal. It was so good.  It was the perfect complement to the chicken. It was  sweeter than a generic hush puppy, which I really appreciated cause change of pace from the intense spices from the chicken.  The density and texture was just right, and it was well executed. Then there was the corn and beans, and that was simply no good.  I felt it would be the a great refreshing side to balance of the spices of the jerk chicken, but it was a miss.  The corn wasn't fresh and lacked that bite and crispness you want from corn. It also lacked the sweetness which made it not very appetizing. The sides made me perplexed.

Then the sauces... first let me preface this by saying the chicken doesn't need the sauces.  The jerk rub stands alone well, but the sauces provide just a nice complementary piece if you want a little something extra.  There were 3 sauces, the rude girl, jerk bbq, and cilantro lime aioli. The rude girl and cilantro lime aioli were excellent, but the jerk bbq, I didn't care for. I feel like the rude girl and cilantro lime aioli worked well with the chicken, but the jerk bbq was an after thought that didn't hold up as well as the other 2.  Like I said though, the sauces were just extra, so technically it's not needed. 

Finally, the service was unfortunately not so helpful. First, when we ordering, the staff didn't really pay attention to us.  It was pretty slow, and we were the only one on the counter so there was no real reason for them not to help us. Then, when our meal came out. It was not complete. It was missing the hush puppy, and did not provide the hush puppy until I was nearly finished with my food.  I was not impressed with service. 

To conclude, I feel like there was a fair amount of misses on my meal, but the chicken is just too good not to go back again.  I can see this place being a 5 rating because of the flavors and execution of the chicken, but everything else has to catch up.  Honestly though, I'm hoping it was just an off day and the rest of the food and service will be better the next time."
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Michele D.,"First off - the food was really authentic and delicious.  I would order this for takeout or delivery in a heartbeat.  

But we dined in on our first experience and felt that Jerk has a bit of an identity crisis.  This restaurant seems conflicted as to whether it is fast food or sit-down.  It has a full bar and the potential to be sit-down, but counter service and food in baskets/plastic makes in seem fast-food ish.  The decor feels solidly in the middle too - where it could go either way.

Other positives - the staff is incredibly hard working.  Everyone was doing something, and a lot of cleaning was going on, so the place was spotless.  And again, the food was delicious!  Just not sure if I would go back to eat there - but will add them to my delivery list!"
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Brent W.,"Have driven by this place dozens of times and maybe due to location, while intriguing, it just never seemed appealing. No parking, busy Chicago/Halsted traffic, meh would be an understatement. 

Look a bit closer and they have free parking around the corner which they'd probably do well to advertise that little friendly fact better. 

That aside it was good. I know crap about Jamaican food other than ""Jerk"" Seasoning or Wings and i'd wager i'm in the majority so they should totally expect a bit of direction for the average Chicago resident.  They do an average job of helping in that department and that's coming from someone who generally can do ""new cuisine"" ok without a lot of hand holding. 

Here's the deal. From what I can tell you're going to shell out roughly $15 for a legit meal and it you want a ""taste"" it will cost you a bit less and you will get faaar less for it.

It was lunch time so without tedious detail i settled on what I thought would be a fulfilling portion for the price.

Jerk Pork Slider $4 - Good but INCREDIBLY TINY. It was sat between a ""Hawaiian Roll"" and finished in three bites. Done. That was it.lol

Jamaican Fries $4 - Also good and was an average price to portion ratio.

Bottle of Jamaican Pop (Ting) - Awesome but 10 0z for $2.

Food + Tax & Tip = $12 and def wanting more. 

[x] Step up your options!"
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Ryan B.,I give Jerk a Meh rating. The food is good but definitely not amazing like the price thinks it is. Plenty of other spots you can go to get more value for your money. The plus side is that it's the only restaurant on this corner by Chicago and Halsted.
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Darren L.,"When attending some food festival last summer, Jerk was the first food stand at the front. I remember thinking it's placed up front for a reason, or perhaps it was at random. Either way, I was impressed by their company after having one bite of their slider. I bookmarked it last year and finally decided to give this place a visit recently. There's a parking lot across the street (yes, it's free!). The restaurant has an awesome vibe to it - you know, dim lights, mason jars, good music type of place. It's very casual dining. You order what you want, take a number, and then they'll call your number. 

I went with my family so we all ordered something different which allowed us to maximize food options. We ordered sliders (pork and beef), jerk chicken, jerk yuca fries, regular fries, chicken wings, and cole slaw. I know it's a lot of food, but it was worth it. Unfortunately, they ran out of the brisket and pork so we weren't able to try that. However, the things we did try were so delicious. Every bite is perfectly seasoned with jerk spice. In addition to it, they give you this house aioli sauce and have plenty of sauces at the table for you to try. Entrees are served with hush puppies that pair nicely with the spiciness. 

Service here was great! The workers are super friendly and look like they genuinely enjoy working there. Five stars for this wonderful place!"
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Maggie L.,"Overall: 3.2/5
Food quality: 3.5/5 . The chicken was good with the selection of sauces on the tables. However, each side is quite expensive, the cole slaw is small, and the rest of the sides that you are supposed to eat the chicken with are just bread. I was really craving some variety in taste and not just a ton of heavy fried carbs.
Value: 3/5 . As mentioned above, I felt that the variety provided was too little for the price.
Speed: 4.5/5 . Food came really quickly 
Environment: 4/5 Very chill, quiet place to get lunch. The people are friendly and I had a good experience."
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Blair M.,"If you are stopping in Chicago, there are many cuisines to try. As a native to the area, you may think of many foods, but the most (pleasantly) surprising item to find in this lovely city is Jamaican food that will blow your mind away. 

We tried Jerk. Modern Jamaican Grill, and found that it is the type of restaurant with no ""go-to"" item. **That's because everything on the menu is delicious!**

We ordered our meat first, opting for Jerk chicken (of course!). The meat was tender, juicy, and the sauces provided at each table were amazing, providing a sweet heat that matches the smoky meat. I loved the Rude Girl sauce.

Lest I forget the sides: sweet plantains, coconut rice and beans (aka rice and peas for those who may be more familiar with Carribean food),
yuca fries, festival (think cornbread) and some of the BEST! (Yeah I said it) macaroni and cheese (seasoned with jerk seasoning). 

Needless to say, I'm in love.

When I come back home, you know where I'm headed!"
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Keith P.,"I've been a loyal customer for a little while now, and dare I say it... I had a bad experience tonight? Order incorrect and the start to finish process from ordering to leaving took 25min? God I hope this was an aberration
:-("
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Patti L.,"I finally made it here. It's just around the corner. The food has great flavor and a little kick. But not sure about the pricing since I haven't had Jamaican food anywhere else. 

I ordered 2 beef sliders ($3.95/ea) and the roasted corn and black beans. The beef sliders were delicious and had a nice kick after the bite. The two I had were enough for lunch along with the roasted corn and black beans. The bread were small rolls and the filling was a nice amount but towards the end a little more bread would have been good. The filling after each bite slid out and fallen out of the sandwich. 

The roasted corn and black beans was refreshing. It cooled the palette of it was too spicy. But the spice was good for me. I may try it again. But $11.00 for lunch is a bit steep for me. Maybe I'll try an entree which includes a side. But it may be too much food."
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Jordan E.,"Really solid jerk seasoned meats and sides. I was really happy my friend showed me this place, as I work at Groupon nearby, and this is an easy walk over lunch spot.

The man behind the counter recommended the quarter chicken, and he was absolutely right. Charred and seasoned to perfection, and had really good jerk flavor. 3 different sauces to use with the meats that were all good on their own, but even better mixed. Then it came with good coleslaw and a heavenly Mac n cheese side.

The real kicker is it comes with a dessert which is like a larger munchkin plain donut, but it was maybe my favorite part of the meal. So savory."
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Helene K.,"So I stop in and place a quick order to go, nothing complicated. Just a quarter chicken entree and wings, but when I got home I opened up the quarter dinner totally burnt! I ask to speak to the manager, he comes on the phone with an attitude, look I just want my money back. Don't go charging ppl for food but serve them garbage and still act like you have a right  in doing that! Check out my ""smoked chicken"", I'm pissed because I drove there and drove home to be hungry! Get it together! Like really the place had only 7-10 people in there. I hate throwing food in the trash! I don't see the reason they think it's okay to serve people some crap like what they gave me! Yeah I'm pissed and you would be too! This place is Such an insult to Jamaican food!"
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Hector R.,"So, I normally like this place. A good amount. For some reason what I normally paid a shade under $12 for I now pay a shade under $14. I don't get extra food or bigger portions - it is just a price increase.

I completely understand that sometimes you have to do this but this is a bit too much for what they offer. I won't be coming here anymore.

jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Michael W.,"Pleasant late Sunday afternoon lunch, avoiding the dreaded ""Brunch is Closing Vortex"" so often encountered at many restaurants on a Sunday afternoon. We were looking for a nice sit down lunch but did not want to deal with a kitchen and staff that were transitioning between Brunch and whatever. My son, who works in the area and occasionally stops at Jerk Chicken for carryout suggested we eat here. Note that my son calls this place ""Jerk Chicken"", suggestion: shorten the name ""Jerk Modern Jamaican Grill"" just a little too long... I was pleasantly surprised, as I did not have high expectations. At least for me, the menu was a little confusing, but with a little help from my son I was on my way. I ordered Jerk Chicken Wings but was informed that they had run out, imagine that a Jerk Chicken place out of Jerk Chicken, oh well. I ordered the Beef Slider instead along with French Fries. The Fries were good, not special but good, the Beef Slider was very good, a nice small sandwich with some incredible flavor. I enjoyed adding the BBQ sauce but did not try the other two sauces. I did get a taste of some of the other items, most of which were quite good and enjoyed by the three of us. The Brisket had those incredible flavors as well and the burnt ends were fantastic. The Macaroni & Cheese is very good, the Hush Puppies were perfect, these are pretty large Hush Puppies, I think you only get one, they bring a nice balance to the meal. I usually love cole slaw but did not care for this version, the Plantains are as good as they look. Fountain drinks are over priced at $2.95, instead go for one fo the Jamaican Sodas, I had the Ting, a grapefruit soda that is very pleasant."
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Baby C.,"Not all cracked up as it could be, the restaurant is nice not a Jamaican feel to it tho. You do have to park across the street it would be on your right side if driving in westbound or on the side street prior to arriving to restaurant if driving in eastbound. The customer service was fine. The food on the other hand is blah. The jerk mac n cheese is gummy thick, the jerk yuca fries was gummy weird texture taste and best believe I know yuca. The patties were basic nothing spectacular about em, the roasted corn with black beans with red onions that overpowered the taste period. Wasn't impressed sorry to say most liking won't be recommending this place."
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Ronisha J.,This place is nice for drinks and friends. Menu is short and sweet. The plantains are to die for!! I'm giving this place  3 stars because the chicken was a bit dry. Tables were filthy and no one came to wipe them down.
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Abrawham H.,"Best jerk spot I've been to in Chicago so far... chicken is tender, & the festivals slammin!!! A lil over priced for them but hey this is as close to Jamaica as Ima get. Their jerk sauce & fries banging too!!!"
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Chloe K.,"In my opinion- best Jamaican food in Chicago! I've been here many times and the seasoning on each meat and side dish is exquisite. This place has chill vibes, the workers are very friendly and make sure to ask if you've got everything. 
The only down side is sometimes they run out of certain meat selections or you may have to wait 25-30 minutes, but other than that I love this place."
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Amy S.,"I have wanted to try this place for a long time. Not worth the wait. Ordered for delivery the wings with a side of coleslaw. Coleslaw never arrived. Would've been nice to temper the heat of the wings. Also ordered the beef patty which appears to have been sitting out a long time. Could barely cut through it and the patty was a tasteless, crusty mess. Didn't care for the mac & cheese, but that could just be a personal taste issue. On the plus side, the wings arrived hot. Plantains were OK."
jerk-modern-jamaican-grill-chicago,Bosie L.,"This was a disappointing experience. It started upon arrival. I went to the area where orders are taken and was ignored. When I finally got someone's attention, they were short with me. Never going back. Poor management."
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Lawrence Y.,"This is located inside the Whole Foods. 

I feel a little strange writing a review where we strictly planned on going to a Whole Foods to eat at their food hall. But we have been on a pretty good Poke kick and wanted to try this out. Garage parking is available at this location first and foremost. 

This Whole Foods makes me feel like I'm at an Eataly, French Market or Latinicity where it's super market meets food hall. The food court is toward the back of the store, and they have indoor and outdoor seating along the river. We had decided to try out Poke Bowl Co which was the main reason for our visit here. You place your order via tablet at the front register - all of which showed calorie counts which was pretty cool. They have some ""additional $"" options so it can get pricey depending on what you like in your poke. Ours basically was about $15-$20/ea just because our inner fatgirls were starving that day. They had lots of options to pick from. The wait wasn't long (they call your name once your order is done) and you either pre-pay when you order or pay at the regular check out. It didn't take them too long to make our bowls. Enough time for us to go and grab beverages and a snacks. The food itself was pretty good and they offer some options that other Poke places do not (for example, kelp noodle). My husband and I were both fairly happy with our meals and we would definitely make this a lunch option again."
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Saphir S.,"I stopped by Whole Foods to return a few things and of course got hungry for lunch! Somehow, I never noticed all the vendors this Whole Foods has- stir fry stand, a diner stand, poke bowls. It's a huge leap forward for Whole Foods where in the past they'd just have a salad bar (with a plethora of toppings might I add). 

You order at the counter from either a set menu option or a custom made order that you create from their mix-ins. Everything takes just a couple of minutes to create and then you pay at the regular Whole Foods registers. 

The employee on duty said the most popular options were the 'Tuna in the raw' and 'Salmon for days' on the set menu. I opted for the large Tune in the raw with brown rice. It's a lot of food and pretty tasty. You do get asked if you want to change any of it up, but I got it as is. 

Make sure to grab a rewards card to rack up a free bowl after 10 visits."
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Michael C.,"Was alright for food within Whole Foods, only thing was that it felt very poorly composed and wasn't very flavorful despite their hugeee list of ingrediants. The fish itself was limited while they stocked the bowls food of things like rice.

Everything is ordered on a digital pad and made fresh. Was also SUPER frustrating cause the order pads would fail to process the orders numerous times (happened to the people next to me as well).

Overall not too bad for a quick bite if you're in Whole Foods anyways. Otherwise i'd probably just make the extra effort and go to an actual pok√© shop."
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Rosa J.,"""Poke Bowl Co"" is inside this Whole Foods in Lincoln Park.  Toward the end of the market there's a food court.  Poke around, then you shall find it!  

Like other poke places in the city, there are pre-set choices (3 of them: tuna, salmon, and veggie creations).  Of course one can build his or her own bowl, starting with protein (no marinated options), toppings (extra $1 with avocado), and sauces (extra $1 with tobiko sauce).  Everything is made-to-order and you can see the workers handling the food.  

The large bowl costs around $13 or $14.  Hubby and I opted for the large size because we were hungry and excited for another ""poke date.""  A large bowl gave out a generous amount of raw fish.  In my ""salmon for days"" bowl, the Korean hot sauce that was drizzled on wasn't overly spicy and it had just the right amount of kick.  

Some of their toppings were their own concoctions and were quite creative.  Although their fish wasn't marinated, it was actually better since there were a plenty of sauces and flavors that the fish absorbed. 

You pay with the centralized checkout near the stairs and elevators leading to the indoor/outdoor dining areas.  I assumed that you can pay with the rest of groceries at the grocery checkout if you're taking your poke bowl home.  

Knowing that ""Poke Bowl Co"" inside the Whole Foods gives an incentive to come over this part of town to ""poke"" around the stores nearby and perhaps pick up some groceries (on sale...since it's slightly over my budge if I choose to shop at Whole Foods for all my everyday grocery needs)."
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Mary T.,"We decided to grab dinner before completing our grocery shopping. I recall reading that a poke shop opened in the store and it seemed like a good option for a ""healthier"" dinner since we usually gravitate toward the taqueria or diner at the store.

We both went with the large poke bowl with tuna and white rice and I got to stay, I was more than a little disappointed.

What I loved was the large option of toppings and sauces for my poke as well as three pre-selected combos. What I didn't love was two things. 

First, the sauces. I tasted the only sauce listed as spicy, a soy-based sauce. I'm not sure why they call it spicy, but spicy it was not. It wasn't overly salty, but salt was the only flavor that came to mind when I tasted it. The way they build the bowl is to section out the ingredients and they put some of the sauce over the fish. For my main sauce, I went with the wasabi aioli, hoping that would add some heat to the bowl. There must be a micro pinch of wasabi in the sauce because there was no horseradishy bite to the sauce at all. I considered the sriracha aioli, but that too wasn't marked as spicy and was noticeably higher in calories than the other sauces, which seemed odd.

Second, the value. The large bowl is about the same as the largest bowl at Aloha Poke. I do give kudos to them for not overloading the bowl with rice. What I didn't like is that the bowl felt like it was only 2/3 full, which made the $14 price tag seem high.

Overall, this is a decent dining option inside the store, but not a favorite. I'd give it another chance, but I won't be running back."
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Linh H.,"Mediocre at best. After frequenting many other poke restaurants in California and others in the Chicago area, I was excited to try this place, located conveniently inside Whole Foods. Unfortunately this place just didn't have what I was looking for. 
My biggest gripes: 

1.) Freshness - I started by selecting a salmon bowl, small-regular sized. Not only is the portion small (approx 1-2 tbsp of sashimi) for what you pay for, but the freshness of the sashimi was not spectacular. There was a fishy aftertaste, which is usually an indicator that the fish just wasn't as fresh as sashimi grade fish should be. To add, the quinoa that I tried with my bowl was undercooked and the seaweed salad a strange brown-green that I've never really seen before.
2.) Ingredients - Very limited toppings. They do not offer masago or crab salad... isn't this the best part of poke bowls? The frustration. 
3.) Price - simply not worth what you're paying for. I paid $10+ for a small poke bowl just to add my own ingredients when I came home. Unfortunately I don't think I'll be back again."
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,carlos q.,"Best Poke in town. Super fresh, healthy and a great value. Caviar add one only $1 is worth it!  Owner Mookie is kinda weird but in a good way."
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Ellary R.,"Finally! So happy to have delicious Pok√© at Whole Foods as an option. Healthy, quick, and most importantly fresh.

pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Kelly C.,"After going to Poke Bowl Co multiple times, I saw today they suddenly labeled their spicy Korean sauce as Containing Gluten. (They explicitly said it was gluten-free before.) Apparently the owner had recently realized the sauce contains gluten and updated the menu accordingly. As a severe celiac, it's crazy that a shop within Whole Foods overlooked this. I had gotten sick after eating before, but never thought it was the poke because of what I was told. Who's to know what else has been overlooked..."
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Jen L.,"Would have preferred mixed greens instead of cabbage but otherwise very good. Fresh, reasonably priced, variety of options to customize to your preference. Would highly recommend!"

pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Jeff C.,"Super fresh fish, great selection of veggies, top notch sauces (try the spicy Korean). Heard they source their ingredients from Whole Foods which is awesome. They make your bowl in a chipotle style line where you can see and choose the ingredients for your bowl unlike some of the other spots I've been to in Chicago.  Great spot and addition to Lincoln Park!"
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Akin A.,"Oh my gawsh oh my gawsh it was so good. I normally am not into sushi or healthy food or that whole genre, but this is so falvorful delish and addicting. I bought one bowl ate it then bought another for lunch but couldn't wait and ate that one too. Don't judge me!"
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Dutch B.,great new option at WF Poke Bowls are pretty darn amazing!
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Ron M.,"This place is a refreshing concept on poke. I came here with my partner who was a vegetarian and she left a little underwhelmed. I ordered a tuna in the raw and my partner got a zen garden. She was  disappointed to find that there is no real protein option offered for vegetarians. When assembling her bowl, she was also disappointed to find that there was no mixed green option apart from some cabbage. My bowl was filling, and tasted quite great. The Sriracha aoli was not spicy at all though. The portion is decent but i feel that they skimp on some toppings and load up the cheaper ones. Also after paying a dollar each for both my wife and I to have an unripe avocado quarter on top, especially after dishing out nearly thirty dollars on two bowls was pretty disheartening. Besides that, the two gentlemen at the counter were kind and patient despite a long line and the toppings were as fresh as could be. I would recommend this place to anyone who loves poke, I don't know if I can say the same about my partner."
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Petar T.,"Quick, fresh, delicious and awesome customer service!!!! Some of the best/freshest tuna I've ever had. The sauces are all amazing and worth exploring as well. And yes, maybe I do like to make my orders a ""little"" unique (read complicated) and most often I feel guilty/high maintenance. But with such fresh and quality ingredients right in your face to chose from, it's hard to resist. Not only did they indulge my ""creativity"", every time I've gone, they've added suggestions for toppings that were right on. It really shows that they take the time and have a passion for what they do. Now if they only delivered...."
pokƒì-bowl-co-chicago-2,Paul E.,"Great poke bowls! I got the create-your-own salmon. High quality salmon and fresh, tasty toppings. The large was a lot of food too! My only criticism is that it's a little pricy (my meal was $13). Overall, though, great meal and service!"
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Nicole S.,"We came to Jieyi for the first time on Valentine's Day for an early dinner, and it was absolutely delicious! Everything we ordered was well prepared, very flavorful, and well presented. 

We started with miso soup and edemame, then had the spicy thai noodles, and finished with a couple sushi rolls. With the assortment of menu items, it was so hard to make a decision on what to order, but the server (i forgot his name) helped us choose. 

I would recommend this place and look forward to coming back soon. Everything about this restaurant was great! I wish I would of tried it sooner!"
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Cristina F.,"Jieyi is my favorite discovery of 2017! We checked out Jieyi after a Bulls game. It was a Friday night and they were open until midnight. It was super easy to find parking (and it was free!). It's a cute neighborhood sushi place. The service was phenomenal! The staff were amazing with the kids we were with. There was another family celebrating a birthday whose toddler was just walking around the restaurant and being cute. 

We loved everything we ordered. The menu was pan Asian and there is something for everyone. Unfortunately, I can't remember the specific rolls. But I definitely recommend their gyoza, it's my roommate's all time favorite. My sister and her friend ordered the fruit smoothies and were obsessed. I've been looking for a place in Chicago with black sesame ice cream and I finally found it at Jieyi! It's delicious, beautifully presented and big enough to share. 

Overall, we had a great time from start to finish and can't wait to go back."
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Shirley J.,"We came here because there was a Groupon for $25 off dinner for two that we got for half off. They also have a $50 off dinner for four option as well.

There are two different sectioned-off group tables, one on each side by the entrance. What's interesting about these tables is that you have to step down in order to sit in them. However, the windows were not insulated well, so there was a huge draft coming from the window that caused my toes to lose feeling. We requested for a different table and ended up sitting in the middle of the restaurant.

APPETIZER
- Taiwanese-style popcorn chicken: I like the crispiness of the chicken. However, it was a tad bit on the bland side. It tasted like it was just seasoned with salt. When we requested sauce on the side, it made the dish taste much better. They gave us sriracha and sweet and sour sauce.

ENTR√âES
- Crunchy roll: This classic maki roll contained shrimp tempura, shredded Alaskan crab, cucmber, radish, sprouts, gobo, wrapped with tempura crunch with eel sauce. It sounds good, but it wasn't! The flavor tasted pretty off, and I can't put my finger on the reason.
- Peppered Salmon roll: This specialty roll contained shredded Alaskan crab, spicy tuna, cucumber, sprouts, topped with pepper-seared salmon, chives, ponzu, and wasabi cream. This was a good roll to try once but not necessarily order again. The roll had a light flavor that was enhanced by the wasabi cream.
- Rock 'n' Roll roll: This specialty roll contained shredded crab, shrimp, octopus, avocado, spicy mayo and crispy tempura coating, topped with eel sauce) except we ordered it without avocado). This was our favorite roll that I'd definitely order again. It's a warm roll that has the right amount of crunch and sweetness to it. Very delectable!

The service was overall good. They checked on us regularly, and one of the gentlemen was very nice. Our server wasn't cheery, but she was nice and quick."
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Srishti S.,"I came here when a friend had snagged a Groupon deal ($23 for $50 value).The sushi here was fresh and well made. Service and ambience was great. Although the place wasn't that crowded for a weekend night, the food was pretty good. The desert was okay- I was tempted to try the mango passion cheesecake, but either it didn't taste that good or the flavors didn't come out very well since it was still frozen when they served it to us."
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Sabrina C.,"Jieyi saved my life Thanksgiving morning when a friend and I were recovering from previous night booze and shenanigans. Of course most places were closed, but Jieyi opened at around 11am to save the day. They got pretty packed rather quickly as well!

I started off with the egg rolls and decided on the Diablo roll - shrimp, cucumber, gobo, topped with baked scallop, shredded crab and eel sauce. It was super filling! I also had a classic Spider roll. Delicious as well.

Surprisingly, I think this is now one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the area."
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Diane M.,"I came here for dinner with a couple of friends last week and were blown away by the extensive menu and service. We were greeted by Paul, who was so nice and attentive! Before we ordered, he went over the menu with us and suggested a couple of highlights along the way. We started off the meal with the Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken which was my favorite. The chicken was flavorful and crispy with crispy basil pieces spread throughout. The Chicken Tom Yum soup had great flavors but very spicy, so warned! We also shared the Tonkatsu ramen, Salmon Skin roll, Godzilla roll, and another roll I can't remember the name of. The fish tasted pretty fresh with good fish/rice ratio. I'll definitely be back again to explore more of the menu!"
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Sarah S.,"Better than expected!

My friend and I went on a Friday night and there were no other patrons the entire time we are in. This made us slightly uncomfy but also worried for this cute little shop. They need to up their promotional game! Add something instagrammable everyone will come for! Just my two cents. I did like this place though and wouldn't mind going again for their rolls or other dishes. Also, we were kind of sad they sat us at a normal table when they have these cool tables along the window. Next time we'll ask to sit there!

Now to the food!
I ordered the Kiss of Dragon roll which was spicy mayo, tempura, kanikama, cream chesse, avocado, topped with Hawaiian white tuna and two special sauces. Liked this roll a whole lot.
We also ordered the Eel combination fried rice.which is not something we'd seen on a menu before, it was different and tasty!
Then their chicken karage is really flavorful with interesting spices, done Taiwanese style and we just loved it. Plus it was a huggggge portion.

We really enjoyed all the food but really hope they get a bit more busy! Their menu is extensive and full of some fun items!"
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Lauren M.,"Ok this lunch special is unreal. Also, the people who work here are so nice! If you want to dine in at a sushi restaurant, I'd say this isn't really the place, although it's nice enough inside and BYO. For me, it's more of a takeout staple. The food isn't the greatest out of what's around (considering there's a TON of sushi spots in Wicker), but it's still pretty good and CHEAP."
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Amy C.,"I LOVE IT HERE. Everyone was super friendly and very fast service. Atmosphere is very calm and chill. If you want a romantic night out, this is the place. Dim lighting and candles to set the mood. Also a good night out for friends. 
The food was amazing! Sushi was very FRESH! Sea bass was very fresh and delicious. It was seasoned REALLY WELL. Calamari was so good!
11/10 would come back and refer to friends!"
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Nikita S.,"I got a living social deal for Jieyi Sushi which was a double bonus because not only is this place down the street from me, I'd been meaning to check it out since I moved in. 

We went around 4pm on a Saturday and the place was empty. A little cold, but I've found most asian restaurants in the city are (idk why). 

I wish I could remember specifically what we ordered but literally everything was phenomenal. We got a specialty roll and then a sushi platter which came with a maki roll and nigiri. Honestly, we didn't need the specialty roll as we were both TOO FULL by the end. 

Ordered cold saki which was really good, just enough in the bottle for the 2 of us. Our total bill was close to $60 for the 2 of us but for good sushi, it was TOTALLY worth it. I paid $12 for $25 for the groupon. Honestly, and I feel bad (almost like I'm cheating) saying this, but it was better than Sea Dog- which if you are a wicker parkian you know sea dog is a staple. 

Disclaimer- I've had friends come here and have mediocre experiences, but we really thought it was fantastic. Service was fast and food so fresh, like it just came out of lake michigan ;)

Will definitely be back. 

Pro tip: they are new in the 'hood so find yourself a groupon/living social and take advantage of a slightly cheaper visit. No doubt they are building clientele with this deal!"
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,John M.,Above and beyond fresh sushi...sashimi......urchin and even my favorite chow fun and Thai Bathai all in this restaurant omg we had so much fun celebrating New Year's Eve....unforgettable and we surely will come back......easy parking.......friendly service
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Stephanie L.,"Went here for some sushi in the hood because it's a ""new"" place.

I'm pretty sure there was some other sushi restaurant here and it's the same co with a different name :/

The staff was all really nice.  The menu is HUGE!  They have a bit of everything...Thai, chinese, Japanese, sushi.  We pretty much stuck to the sushi.  Nothing was bad...everything was very mediocre though.  The rolls are huge!!  Like so many pieces!  

It's a byob joint so it could be a cheap night out.  Overall, I still love me some butterfly sushi but this is ok."
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Gina B.,"I stopped here on a whim, and was pleasantly surprised. The food is tasty and very reasonably priced. It also has all kinds of Asian cuisine if you don't just want the sushi. I went with a friend, and ordered 4-5 different things, including two rolls. The portions for the curry and the other entr√©e dishes are large. The sushi rolls are big as well with more fish, less rice. 4/5 stars for food. I would come here if I wanted some quick good food. 

The reason this place gets 5 stars was because of Paul. Amazing service that I can compare to some Michelin star restaurants I've been to. He was extremely attentive without being overbearing. Every dish that was placed on the table was very thoughtfully arranged for both eating convenience and aesthetic. He instantly noticed that we were low on tea, and also the need for containers since we definitely could not finish all our food. He also stopped and had a nice conversation with us (again, not intruding at all. He read the atmosphere and came over to chat). Thank you Paul if you are reading this! I'll stop by again."
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Kia A.,"Best sushi in west loop and Chicago! Super friendly employees and affordable deals!
Besides sushi they have other great asian cuisine like ramen and fried rice, and mochi ice cream!"
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Diana C.,"This restaurant is an amazing sushi spot! Food is delicious, wide selection, and the service is above and beyond. Paul was our server and he is super nice! We tried spicy miso ramen and peppered salmon roll. Loved it! They have nice drink menu, and I love how they serve tea!"
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Jon D.,"This might be my second yelp review ever because I only write them if I have had the perfect experience, and this was nothing short of that. 
Saturday night 12/16/17 11:30pm my girlfriend and I are trying to figure out where to eat and we find Jieyi on Yelp. My gf calls to confirm they are open and makes a reservation for between 12:00 and 12:30 am. We arrive around 12:15am, and are immediately greeted by Paul. He takes us to our table and from then on our experience was fantastic. Had a cocktail from their list which was great, went over the menu with a friend of Paul's, Alex I believe and then was ready to give our order. My gf got beef and broccoli and loved it, it was tender and delicious and reminded her of her mother's recipe. I ordered classic cuts of nigiri to start and was very pleased with how tender and fresh the fish was. The fish to rice ratio was pleasing, and the size of the pieces of fish were generous. We were given complimentary warm sake to cleanse our pallets before the first round of sushi arrived. We also got a bottle of sake which completed the sushi so well. I also ordered some sashimi and was very please with the style in which they cut the fish and the Ono was to die for. They have classic rolls and more creative ones, both are done well with a lot of care. I give this restaurant 5 stars because it was a great experience from start to finish. Make sure you get a smoothie at the end of your meal, they do them right here! Thanks again for everything Jieyi Sushi I will be back!!"
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Troy M.,"Is there a food known to man more polarizing than sushi? Some could eat it multiple times a week while others develop dry heaves just at the mention of the word. Those who are passionate about it are really passionate about it. How many times have you said, ""X restaurant has the best sushi in the city""? Sushi's not the type of food that's going to illicit a response like, ""I could take it or leave it."" Look closer, and even for those that love it, one (what seems like) minor ingredient change or substitution can make a piece of sushi gag-worthy or the best thing ever put into one's mouth. For example, I'm an enormous sushi fan, but give me a roll with shrimp and I'll give you a rage-filled man. Give my dining partner cucumber, and she's liable to make sure you never walk again. Yes, we're sushi lovers, but we don't love all types of sushi. And that makes writing and trusting sushi reviews so difficult. A rainbow roll could contain the same ingredients, but whether you eat it at a sushi bistro in Walla Walla or Williamsburg, it's just gonna taste different.

""Jieyi"" means ""to care about"" in Chinese. And though Jieyi Sushi provides some Chinese inspired cuisine, you'll mainly find Japanese and Thai here. After several sub-par sushi experiences in the neighborhood, my dining partner procured a Groupon to give this still-relatively-new spot a try. 

On this Friday night, we were seated immediately and provided with water. The ambiance is calm and relaxing, with warm colors and no distracting music. The restaurant is an adequate size with plenty of seating and options to eat in a secluded space by the window or at the sushi bar. My dining partner began with an order of Miso Soup. Taste-wise it was unexceptional, and contained enough seaweed for three more soups. We split some Nigiri, which tasted fresh but on the bland side. As for the sushi, dear reader, we ordered two rolls: Rainbow (Eel and Tempura Crunch Wrapped with Yellowtail, Tuna, Salmon, Avocado) and Mellow Yellow (Salmon, Tempura Crunch, Avocado, Spicy Mayo, Topped with Mango, Ginger Sauce, Dried Chili Flakes). Service seemed a tad slow, but not unbearably so. Plus, I understand it takes time to prepare the sushi a certain way on the plate. 

We were drawn to the inclusion of mango on the Mellow Yellow. It was tasty, but I'm not sure it was necessary other than to give the roll its rhyming name. I wouldn't get it again, but I'm glad I tried it. The Rainbow was a bit better and I thought the presentation with the different types of fish displayed was a real knock-out. Like the Nigiri, everything tasted fresh and not at all fishy. The portions were a good size, if we hadn't gotten the Nigiri, another roll (the Firecracker, perhaps?) would have been in order.

Jieyi Sushi also offers sushi boats, ramen and special plates of various proteins. The waitress was extremely attentive throughout, and the Groupon was happily accepted. We were even given fortune cookies at the meal's end. Mine promised, ""everything will now come your way"". Everything? After I got to thinking about it, I felt pretty overwhelmed and have been curled up in the fetal position since.

I've been to a handful of sushi restaurants in the Wicker Park neighborhood (only about a million more to go) and this is the current frontrunner in terms of taste and bang for your buck. If you can snag a Groupon, it's really a no-brainer.

Food: ****
Atmosphere: ****
Service: ****
Overall: ****"
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Ameer S.,"I came for lunch, and it was a good reminder to always check to be sure yelp discounts are actually still effective as I was surprised to find that they did not take the 50% off lunch-time sushi as offered on yelp with checking in. The sushi was unfortunately mediocre and not worth the full price, but the waitress was absolutely sweet and apologetic. It turns out that she's told the owner plenty of times to take down that discount and he has neglected to do so. Reckless management."
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,fadi a.,"Great little spot. Very fresh yellow tail belly! 

Quick tip - Free parking after 6:30 weekdays and free parking after 12 on the weekend.

Really enjoyed the smoked salmon roll!"
jieyi-sushi-chicago-3,Kiya K.,I felt compelled- BEST SUSHI I'VE HAD SINCE ...I can't even remember Hama and Mellow Yellow mango roll pictured here- super fresh and explosive taste! Only thing better than the food was the service! Impeccable!!
home-team-pizza-chicago,Brent W.,"This is my brain on pizza...*insert requisite happy dance emoji*

This is my brain on finding a new, undiscovered pizza joint....AND it ending up being ridiculously good, bringing together all the necessary pizza components in nearly the exact way ""I"" would if I were to make the ""perfect"" pizza...*insert MIND BLOWN emoji*

yea, it went like that."
home-team-pizza-chicago,Marlyn L.,"Home Team Pizza is like going on a date with someone who is super nice, decent enough ingredients, good temperature, you've had worse but in the end, it's not really blowing your mind. 

Got pizza for delivery through DoorDash. Very happy with the speed, the pizza arrived hot, the Coke came cold, and my appetite was appeased.

Crust is lacking in flavor. It's just a vehicle for the cheese and sauce. The sauce is okay. The cheese is aight. The pepperoni was a little on the smaller side. 

What I did like was that the price was reasonable and the pizza was not extremely greasy (just enough from the pep). 

I'd say give it a try, especially if it's nearby and your other options are places like Bacci or Rosati's. But don't go out of your way otherwise."
home-team-pizza-chicago,Rae O.,"Seriously yelp, when are the half star personal ratings coming out?
This place gets a 3.5 from me. Local neighborhood place next door to Nini's Deli. They have a cute take-out window. The pizza is okay. Thin crust style."
home-team-pizza-chicago,Kim P.,"If you like thin style, you'll love Home Team Pizza. The ingredients are high quality and their delivery is fast. Definitely a go-to pizza spot in my house."
home-team-pizza-chicago,Jaclyn W.,"Very friendly staff. I had a slice of sausage pizza and it was pretty good. I think the pizza was $3.65 if I remember correctly. They also sell cans of Pepsi products for .50. They sell a 16 inch pizza for $10, next time I will try that."
home-team-pizza-chicago,Carolina N.,"I recently moved to the neighborhood and was afraid that I wasn't going to have a go-to pizza place. FOUND IT! Home Team Pizza has my favorite thin crust pizza right now, and the prices are really great. Tip: if you like pesto, order a pesto, cheese, and tomato."
home-team-pizza-chicago,Carolina K.,"They made up for the late delivery and delivered my pizza and a beef sandwich in under 40 minutes! All was great! As the 4 star rating states on yelp, ""I'm a fan!"" Thanks Home Team Pizza!"
home-team-pizza-chicago,Kunal O.,"What a beautiful hidden gem in West Chicago! If you enjoy pizza at a cheap prize than look no further!  To put alittle context around this review and order, I am a vegetarian whole lived in Europe for a 6 year stretch and believe myself to be rather particular about my taste in pizza.  The location honestly looked like a delivery pick up garage however rest assured it is a great pizza location. As a vegetarian, I have to say I really take personal comfort when the staff asks me to be more specific about my restrictions, and they did not fail me there!  Further, they offered me a list of all their vegetarian toppings and suggested their personal favorite combinations.  In the end we went with a red sauce pizza with mushrooms + jalape√±os and a white sauce pizza with pesto sauce.  I cannot praise the two pizzas enough.  The pesto pizza served well as an appetizer while the  mushroom+ jalape√±o pizza is more of a traditional red sauce pizza.  I would highly recommend this place for the tasty and superb thin crust pizzas! As a note; the jalape√±os  comes with a a serious kick, beware!"
home-team-pizza-chicago,Daniel W.,"Awesome classic Friday night pizza. The pizza is solid all around. Sauce is tasty, cheese is plentiful, and the sausage is on point! The sausage has nice bits of fennel and doesn't taste too fatty. Very well executed pizza for a bargain price in my opinion. 

The place appears to be run by a family which reminds me of my past helping out my mom at our restaurant. I'm always willing to support mom and pop restaurants because of my past. So go support the Home Team!! You won't be disappointed. 

Cash only. 

I'll be back.."
home-team-pizza-chicago,Kim Z.,"Everything was delicious and quick. I ordered a sunshine salad, half sausage half cheese pizza, cheesecake and a cupcake. The pizza was cooked just right, with enough brown to be crisp and tasty. The cheesecake was yummy, and the food arrived 25 minutes after ordering delivery on a Saturday night at 7 pm. I have zero complaints. That alone is worth five stars."
home-team-pizza-chicago,Jennifer C.,Was craving pizza on lunch and after reading reviews decided to try Home Team. Love the outside of building walked past and drove past many times but never thought it was open at least during the day. It typical small pizza place small better for take out small had 4 tables and staff seemed friendly. Came at noon on a Thursday. There were two pizza in oven displayed could possibly been there since open. I order the slice of thin all beef sausage. They offered to heat it for me took couple mins and offered pre packaged cheese and pepper. I took my nicely wrapped slice and off to enjoy. The pizza was hot and delicious the cheese had a nice pull and not burnt cheese. Liked the light flavorful sauce not sweet but tangy and nice seasoning of herbs. I'm looking forward to returning for the $10 cheese large pizza. This is definitely a great go to pizza for crowd of picky and easy to please. Not the best but I would definitely come here again for price and good quality ingredients.
home-team-pizza-chicago,Alex B.,"Awesome pizza, awesome price, awesome service.

I get this all the time for lunch at work, and we order it for the office pretty frequently too and everyone is always happy. The deals are awesome and the pizza is always tasty.

Try the cheesecake!!! It is fantastic."
home-team-pizza-chicago,Julia D.,My favorite thin crust pizza in Chicago! The staff is very friendly and delivery is quick. Five stars!
home-team-pizza-chicago,Sara M.,"What else is there to say than good think crust brick oven pizza at a great price! It's awesome having a pizza place within walking distance from the house. This is my second stop in for a carry out and the staff is super friendly, with a small eating space and a pizza slice window! It's a great touch that after putting in a phone order they give you a call to let you know your pizza is ready for pickup. Got mine home while it was still pipping hot. Definitely a neighborhood must try for either a whole pizza or just a slice. Bonus they are open 7days a week from 11-11pm and just started selling sandwiches and a 16inch cheese is $10! Can't go wrong!!"
home-team-pizza-chicago,Mona M.,"We ordered Pizza from here for a large party. Not only did the delivery arrive on time, but everyone loved the pizzas. Highly recommend this place for their pizzas and friendly staff."
home-team-pizza-chicago,Ameer S.,"Great mom and pop pizzeria. The son took my order and seemed like a super polite and kind kid. I had a slice, which was decent, but I'm looking forward to trying their fresh, whole pizzas made to order."
home-team-pizza-chicago,Sara M.,"Had 10 pizzas delivered to our wedding as a late night snack from Home Team. Although I didn't have any, the guests raved about it! Mike and his family were super helpful in the ordering process and they delivered on time! Thanks for everything!!"
home-team-pizza-chicago,John R.,"No complaints about the food or service in particular. I'm glad that this place sells pizza by the slice, saving me some money when I don't want to buy the whole pie. The pizza was fine and I like the crispy thin crust. Also, their individual slices are a good size - so you're getting a great value overall.

The stars lost here is mostly due to the packaging for individual slices when you get them to go. They slip the pizza slices into a bag and if you carry multiple slices back home, the cheese can get stuck to the bag if you stack them on top of each other.

The space in the restaurant is pretty small, so it works best if you just get your order to go."
home-team-pizza-chicago,julie q.,"I started to have a ""I don't like pizza anymore"" lifestyle. But....the husbo ordered this pizza last night and I'm back to my old self. Cracker thin crust, not too sweet sauce, lots of sausage and although canned, mushrooms galore. And I like the canned shrooms. It gives a little more flavor than fresh.  $30 for a large 3 topper. Not the cheapest but worth it. It's good and fast. And the parents from KY enjoyed it immensely."
home-team-pizza-chicago,Natalie M.,"Great service and pizza overall! I ordered online from Slice for the office, we forgot to add brownies so I called and had them added to my order, no problem. The pizza was delivered on time which was awesome, especially on a Friday. 1/2 cheese 1/2 pepperoni - it was a little greasy but that was the only problem! Nice sauce and good portion of cheese and pep. Definitely will be ordering again because of the great service, price, and taste."
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Liz B.,"If I could eat sushi everyday I would. And if I was eating sushi everyday Seadog would be one of my go-to spots.

Part of my love for Seadog comes from the fact that it's very convenient for me, but even if I didn't live nearby I would still be a fan. Their fish is fresh, the rice is the right amount of cooked and they have really good special rolls. A lot of sushi spots in Chicago include cream cheese in their special rolls, which isn't my thing. Seadog has a few but has a lot of cream cheese free rolls as well. Personal faves are the triple S, the midnight sundae and the lover rolls. 

I mostly do takeout from here. The inside is a little dark and cramped so I usually opt to go somewhere else if it's cold out and we're going to eat in. However, there are some tables that feel more spacious by the window and along the wall. The back patio is a great spot to sit outside when it's nice out."
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Liz T.,"I live down the street from Seadog and used to really like this place, but my last two experiences were not good. The first time, I figured it was an off night. But now that it's happened TWO times, I really feel like the quality of this business has gone down hill, and they're officially losing my business. :(

First of all, I was such a regular that I got a $5 LOYALTY credit. When the loyalty credit wasn't working with their online system, I printed it and brought it in. Not only were they unable to take off the $5 in person, but I e-mailed for help on redeeming it online and never got a response. Is the loyalty credit even a real thing? Was it a trick?! I guess I'll never kow.

Second, they recently added Poke to their menu. I am a HUGE Poke fan, and with the closing of Firefin, have been looking for other places to go. I ordered the Spicy Salmon Poke--and was super excited to see an item with 8 ingredients + sweet potato tempura. To my surprise, I opened up my carryout to find only rice, fish, and tempura in the bowl. First of all, that's NOT a Poke bowl. That's just a rice and fish bowl.

Since I live down the street, I decided to go back to get the garnishes. Sesame, nori, scallions, etc. may seem insignificant, but these are important flavor items. When I explained what had happened, they reluctantly took the bowl back to add these back in, but then tried to convince me that these ""additional items"" are ""add-ons,"" and that they were doing me a favor by adding them back. She then went on to add that ""next time"" I'd have to pay an extra $2. When I showed her the online menu, she looked confused, and went to consult with the sushi chef who made my food. After some back and forth, I told her that ALL Poke should have these garnishes for flavor--that most places also offer more veggies and togarashi--and if they don't want to include these in their $17 bowl, they shouldn't offer Poke.

But they made no apology, tried to blame me for this issue, tried to charge $2 extra for some sesame, nori, and scallions, and then tried to say that it's reasonable to charge $17 for a Poke bowl that is only rice and fish. *Long sigh.*"
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Beth G.,"I've been to Seadog several times and I think it gets a little better each time I go.  The atmosphere is nice and cozy inside, perfect for a chilly fall or winter day. And when it's nice outside, there is a cute little patio out back. It's convenient to public transportation, right where Ashland/Division/Milwaukee converge.   

The menu is huge, but they do everything well. Their rolls are heavy on the ingredients and light on rice, which is always a plus. And they do some unusual experiments with ingredients like rice paper, strawberries, and mango. (And were doing it before these ingredients were a little more mainstream.)  

BYOB, friendly service, and rarely a wait for a table. Good for carry-out too. It's not the best sushi I've ever had in my life but it's definitely always reliable, economical and enjoyable."
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Meag H.,"Wow!  This is such a creative sushi bar!  Each specialty roll is unique & SO fresh!  Nothing was heavy, every single bite was excellent!  Service was very attentive & considerate.  My only caution is that preparation is a bit slow, but in my opinion it's well worth the wait!"
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Kelly P.,"Quick delivery! I absolutely love
The ""lover sushi"" it's so gooood!!!!the orange sauce that came with it definitely made it even better."
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Tiffany F.,"WOW! We heard good things but this was better than expected. For the location, this couldn't be better. Once you get on the other side of Ashland, I always kind of wonder about the places, but this was top notch. We called ahead and weren't able to make a reservation, but got there around 7:30 with 6 people and were seated right away outside on the super cute patio. 

The menu is kind of strange because they have huge glossy photos of everything, but it actually ended up helping a lot. I've never used a menu like that and actually liked the food before haha. But we got seaweed salad for the table and a bunch of rolls. Everyone enjoyed everything. It's byob, so bring wine! Definitely will go back here again sometime soon."
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Jacqueline F.,"Sushi was good but it wasn't the best sushi I've ever had.  The place was small and intimate but still had a table available in the back area for all 6 of us girls for a bachelorette dinner.  They also have outdoor seating available. I liked the vibe as it played club and dancey beats, so it gets you in the mood for going out afterwards.  Plus it's BYOB!

I only gave it 3 stars because our food took forever to be ready.  I think we waited close to 45 minutes for 7 rolls of sushi to get to our table.  And for 6 hungry girls who just came from 8 hours of day drinking, that didn't sit too well for me.  Also, it seemed like not enough waiters/waitresses were working that day and it was a Saturday night!  The place was not packed and there was no excuse for the food to take that long.

Plus, those with small bladders beware.  There is only one stall for the girls bathroom so I had to go use the men's bathroom as there was a long line to use the women's.  So total stalls is 2.  Thought u guys should know."
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Jayme H.,"There are several sushi spots near the Division blue line stop and I do believe I've tried most of them. I can say that Seadog is easily my favorite out of the bunch! 

The environment inside is very chill. I love how it's dimly lit and how you can kinda disappear into your own world while you're in there. They also have a huge patio out back, which is where I always opt to sit as long as the weather is nice. 

The staff is always friendly but there have been a few instances where I felt like I was waiting it bit longer than I should. Usually after I get my water and I want to order or when I'm waiting for my bill. Regardless the food makes up for that! 

Lately they've had a great check-in offer for an appetizer, Sweet potato tempura I believe. It comes with a delicious dipping sauce, which my table likes to hold onto during our meal to use on other things. I think this is a wonderful way to start your meal. I also like to get things started with some spicy miso soup or gyoza. Both are fantastic here at Seadog! In terms of rolls I've had the Dragon, the Little Sea Monster, and the Volcano. I enjoy all of them! I've tried others via friend's plates but I can't remember the name of them. Needless to say, everything I've had here is great!

Whether your hungry for food to go or want to go sit down somewhere to relax with friends, you can do it here at Seadog! Oh yeah -- it's also BYOB so feel free to grab a bottle of wine before you walk over. That's just the icing on the cake!"
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Justin A.,"This is a really great sushi restaurant hidden in Chicago.  It is my favorite sushi restaurant here. The food was unique and inventive, but also really tasty.  I enjoyed all of the sushi!  Dessert was only meh, but that is fine because I came for the sushi.

It's a cute little place.  Right near the blue line stop too! Takes reservations and credit cards.

Also BYOB!!"
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Jenny Y.,Loved the rolls here- perhaps a tad smaller than I expected but made up for it in the deliciousness and freshness.  The flavors are unique and the choices are really endless.  They also had accurate pictures next to some of the rolls to help your indecisiveness.  Also tried the sweet potato tempura which was lightly fried and not overly greasy.  The interior is cozy and has a very romantic feel and they had plenty of seats as well as a nook near the window (obsessed with nooks). Came here after a show at the Chopin theater and shared a few rolls and will gladly come back.  Definitely a top mid priced sushi joint in Chicago in my book!
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Amy F.,Amazing! Seadog Sushi has taken over as my #1 byob sushi spot! Ton of options on the menu and they even have pictures on the menu which I love! I also saw they had an outdoor patio in the back so I'll be back!
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Athina L.,Delicious rolls and reasonable priced. Packed house on a Friday night when we went but didn't have to make reservations. Great byob spot! Will definitely be back
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Eda X.,"Seadog is quite the cozy sushi restaurant! I prefer sitting at the bar to be able to see my food in an otherwise dark dining room. Free sweet potato tempura and spicy mayo upon Yelp check-in. Highly recommend the sea monster roll for folks who loves soft shelled crab, cream cheese, bread crumbs and large portions. The spooky and dragon are also tasty choices. I couldn't pass up on matcha cr√®me br√ªl√©e. Strong flavors all around. Very pleased with the fresh ingredients and generous amount of sauces for each roll. 

Late night patrons get 20% off their check after 9pm on weekdays and 10pm on weekends."
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Gaby V.,"This is a great place! It seems very cozy. It's byob , which is even better. I highly recommend the spicy miso soup. I had two bowls it was so good. I dined in with 2 other people and we ordered a couple of rolls. The spider roll, was so good. The rainbow king is equally as good. We loved the triple S. Overall I loved the sushi and the establishment. I will be back, as often as I can."
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Lauren M.,"My boyfriend and I were joking that I should give it one star for how bad the music was (acoustic EDM covers whyyyyyy tho) but everything else was above average. Our table was super tiny, so we had to keep our bottle of wine on the floor which was odd, but BYO so I'm not crying. The sushi was good and it was priced well. Now can it compete with the million other sushi spots in Wicker/Bucktown/Ukrainian Village??? Idk idc."
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Christopher V.,"Two stars for the Spicy Miso and the maki being edible. Service was fair, but super slow. Edamame was room temperature. Tried four rolls. ..with the exception of cream cheese and avocado everything was flavorless. Blew $80 on mediocre sushi without drinks."
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Mike V.,"Small front room with close seating and very loud on a weekend. They also have a back room which is better, would recommend back room for date/out with friends. Very nice sushi!!! Reasonable prices, beautiful presentation. Great service, fast, friendly, high quality food. Lots of variety and the sashimi is very large. Highly recommend, just sit in the back, loud noise in front is why I'm giving 4 stars"
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Ally F.,Amazing spot to get sushi if you're in the Wicker Park/Bucktown area.  BYOB and I heard they have an amazing patio in the summers.
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Hannah L.,"Walked in and asked how long the wait was going to be for two people. The hostess said give me a second and never got back to us. We waited for about 20 minutes which wasn't bad, but getting to the table, it was surrounded by trash(see photo). About 5 minutes after getting our menus, the waiter said I'll be right back to take your order, didn't return until 10 minutes after. 

We ordered the takoyaki, rainbow roll, white crunchy roll, spider roll, and got the free sweet potato tempura. The order didn't take too long to come out, which made me more optimistic, but after my second piece of the rainbow roll, I felt something hard in my mouth and spit out a fish scale-like object (see photo). On top of that, the waiter checked on us only once. The food wasn't bad, minus the fish scale, but the service was really not up to par."
seadog-sushi-bar-chicago,Shannon E.,"My friends seemed to really like this place. I, however, was unable to enjoy myself here. This place fell flat for me. Womp. Womp."
mod-pizza-chicago-6,Michael S.,"MOD pizza just opened in Lincoln Park. They have a bunch of restaurants in the suburbs and we wanted to try out MOD. They have an extensive menu of different pizzas or you can create your own. We chose the pizzas that are on the menu and didn't venture out to create our own. I ordered the Calexico pizza. This is their signature hot pizza and the staff highly recommended it. The calexico came with grilled chicken, mozzarella cheese, hot sauce, jalape√±os, blue cheese, and hot buffalo sauce after it came out of the oven. Let me tell you it was hot! The jalape√±os pushed it over, glad they had plenty of water. I love hot food so I really enjoyed the pizza.

My fianc√© ordered the six inch pizza and I had the eleven inch. The six inch is plenty of pizza to have if you aren't sharing. They accidentally didn't put in her pizza in the oven so it took a little while longer to get the pizza. They gave us complimentary bread sticks which was very nice of them. They call them garlic strips at MOD. They were alright but nothing too special. The pizza was very delicious and for sure worth trying. They have fresh squeezed lemonade which is also great. Definitely come give MOD a try and you will be glad you did."
mod-pizza-chicago-6,Eve H.,"Mod Pizza, is the newest entry at 1000 W. North Ave. It is designed in a similar style to Blaze Pizza, In both places you can build your own pizza! The difference is Mod gives you a choice of size of pizza. At this point all the ingredients were extra fresh and available. The pizza crust was extra thin and crisp, it was delicious! The staff was great, very eager to please and very knowledgeable about the product. This is a great place to stop in for a snack or bring your children. I gave Mod Pizza Five stars because they have parking, a large variety of pizza, and a staff willing to please. I can't wait to go back!"
mod-pizza-chicago-6,Naywri W.,"This is the second Chicagoland location. There known out in the 'burbs. This is a BYO (build your own). I had the Garlic Strips with Pesto dip. They were good. I talked to the GM and I asked ""what was the difference between you'll and Blaze and he said ""were community based, not about revenue."" I was running short on time so I'll be back for the pizza, lol."
mod-pizza-chicago-6,Spenser B.,"Okay, so I'm a Postmates driver, it was getting slow, came in to MOD, ordered a simple cheese pepperoni and sausage pizza right? All of a sudden my phone went off and I had a trip available. I asked if they could hold the pizza for a few minutes, they said yes, and I went to go do my thing. Well, another trip became available, then another, then another. Next thing I know, it's been like 3 hours. So I decide to put the app on hold to come back to MOD to get the pizza I ordered. The second I walked in, every. Single. Employee said my name. One even made a joke about them sending a search party for me. The manager, I think? Made me a new one because the other one was ""too old"". It was supper entertaining and really nice of them to remember me and get me a new one. I give this place a 5 star because they're a some great people who work here. 

...I kind of feel bad now that they all know me and I don't know a single one of their names...

HIGHLY RECOMMEND! MUST STOP BY IF YOU CAN!"
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Tiany T.,"I alway pass by this place because my office is located on goose island, i always see many cars lined outside and that's how i judge if worth to give it a try. 
Me and my hubby feeling some deep fried food and this place just pop up in my mind. 
We ordered half pound of shrimp/scallop/mussel and fried mushroom, i have to say the seafood quality are great!! I didn't expect a place like this severing good quality seafood at very very low price!  Everything was delicious, will definitely come back more!"
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Jennifer G.,"I've wanted to try Shrimp House for a while now and finally had the opportunity to last week.  As mentioned before, it's cash only without an ATM onsite.  There is also no seating inside - just two arcade games you can play while waiting for your food.  We ordered a half a pound of the shrimp and ¬æ a pound of scallops and the clam strips.  They weren't busy at the time and it took less than 10 minutes for our order to be ready.  

The scallops were the shining star of this meal and I wish we got more.  They paired beautifully with the hot pink sauce that comes with each item.  The shrimp were good, too.  We got the regular shrimp and they were quite large.  I can only imagine but the jumbo shrimp looked like!  The clam strips were okay, but I would not order them again.  

Price-wise, this place is a steal!  We got all this food for less than $18.  It was delicious and I will be back again!"
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Cely R.,"my first time here i order 1/2 lb of regular fried shrimp sm fries and extra sauce was really good 
the  guy in the counter is so friendly 
is cash only and is no atm here 
and is only to take out
so bring cash and leave tips for his big christmas box =)"
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Louie N.,"This place is a gem for good greasy seafood.  The decor never changes.  It's clean and basic.  The food is a treat though.  The food is always the same, very consistent after all of these years.  I work nearby so it's really too tempting to be near them.  This is a once in awhile treat.   I ordered the mushrooms which were good...apparently because I ate them before taking a pic.  Lol.  Also ordered the jumbo scrimps, yes I spelled it correctly...when they are this good they are scrimps, not shrimps.  And I ordered the scallops.  I tried to eat one but the grease shot out from it.   My poor arteries.  The order taker/cashier was nice, friendly.  You pay when your food is ready.   Will I be back????  Of course I will..anyplace that satisfies my craving for seafood & grease, YASS!!!!!  The only negative thing I can say is that they only give 1 sauce of each, $.15 extra for each sauce.  They know u need more than that.  Lol."
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,John B.,"I live not too far from Goose Island Shrimp House and drive by the place all the time. I have always wanted to go there, and fortunately walked home after dropping my car off for servicing at Lexus down the street.

This is a great fried fish spot. We tried the fried clams and shrimp. It was great. I next want to try the fried fish and chips. I bet that will be good.

Great service, cheap price, good food."
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Khalilah W.,"I absolutely love this place! There are a few good shrimp places in Chicago,but this is my favorite because the prices are cheaper,they are open until 4 or 5am,AND dear God the hot sauce is AMAZING! It's homemade and awesome. Potato chips are like 40 cents,canned soda is 70 cents. 

I do like Lawrence's ,but 4 of us ate GOOD for $30 at Goose and that same order is $50 at Lawrence's... 

Goose Island also has scallops,frog legs,oysters,and a few side dishes. I've never tasted any of those things,but I do know the potato salad is only 50 cents,so yay!

I'm not too comfortable in the area,I've never had any issues but I don't think that I'd go alone at 2am as a woman( or anywhere actually).There is no seating,We always park somewhere to eat. Don't wait until you get home or you'll miss how hot and juicy the shrimp is. 

Favorite item is the 1lb of shrimp,it's plenty for 2 people,no need to get the Jumbo. This places regular shrimp is the size of the jumbo shrimp at most places. Our last order was 1lb shrimp,1 lb catfish,1/2 lb shrimp,2 bags of chips,and 4 soda's. The total was around $29 Four of us shared and all of us were full and happy. 

If you go alone I'd try 1/2 lb shrimp and 1/2 lb of catfish just to taste it,some people don't like the breading,it is slightly thicker than other places,I love it. The breading also holds up if you have to microwave leftovers. Tip #1 order extra hot sauce
Tip #2 for leftovers 30 seconds is enough
#3 watch out for bones in the catfish,if u have children pick through it.
The cocktail sauce tastes like "" mild sauce"" from the chicken joints and does not seem to compliment the food."
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Jacob G.,Goose Island is a real hole in the wall. Their fried shrimp is one of the best in Chicago. It's so good.
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Tonya K.,Excellent and filling as usual. Got a pound of jumbo shrimp and a pound of regular shrimp to feed 3 and there was more than enough for everyone. Service was great.
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Ioana M.,"Good catfish and good fish and chips, was very excited to try the shrimp but sadly the shrimp smelled AND tasted like it just came out of a chlorine bucket!! That ruined the whole meal and made us stop eating, would never go again."
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Julie T.,"THE BEST BATTERED SHRIMP EVER! The scallops, catfish, and frog legs! With the house sauce! Don't forget to get extra sauce! The guys there are amazing and super nice!"
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Jeanette J.,"Best fried seafood in the City!  The jumbo shrimp are colossal.  Everything is fried perfectly so it is not greasy.  Super inexpensive.  The oysters are huge and delicious!  

Tonight it was meaty frog legs, huge scallops - amazing and, of course, clams!  This place is so inexpensive & fresh.  I have been eating here for 30 years & it's consistently EXCELLENT!!!"
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Sofia G.,"The shrimp are huuuge.  Breading is perfectly crunchy. The hot sauce is home made and the perfect amount of tart and spice.  Perfect place for late night eating after partying or for a delicious dinner after work.  First time walking I was a little taken back because there was no room from how busy they were. It was so worth the wait.

Take out only.  Took me a very well worth it half hour wait to get our food when they were busy.  Call ahead.  Cash only."
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Grant S.,"This is the worst imitation of southern home cooking that I have ever tasted. 

The coating  for the catfish had too much cornmeal. The slices of catfish were too thins and overcooked. The quality of catfish is subpar and your hot sauce is as well. The toughness and taste of the fish would have been better covered with red roster or crystal hot sauce than your own sauce.

I try to give every restaurant and business the benefit of the doubt, however, I'll never come back to your establishment. This isn't a southern fish fry. This is a picnic hosted by your blind great grandma that has been lied to repeatedly by the family. Tell her the truth! Frying food is simple and you, goose island shrimp house, have failed.

She would know you were lying. Tell the tough! It's granular!!!"
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Dusty M.,"Can be a very good shrimp house but they use too much breading on their cat fish nuggets, fish nuggets, shrimp and Frog legs. If you say you're shrimp or from legs for the next day you can really see and taste the difference with all of that breading"
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Amanda C.,Absolutely delicious! The guys at the front are funny! I had the krab salad & 3/4 lb of jumbo shrimp and I was a happy camper! The house cocktail sauce is yummy! Super fresh and delicious. Next time I want shrimp guess where I'm going?!
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,trixie jane m.,Hands down best shrimp and scallops in the city!!!! I've been going here for over 10 years. Memories having a bag of shrimp when I worked at the Mercantile stock exchange and late nights after clubbing at zentra and crowbar.  Talk about taking it back old school.
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Maiesha T.,"When my husband was courting me about 10 years ago, he would bring me Goose Island Shrimp at random hours. I enjoy the spicy dipping sauce but don't really care too much for the breading but I love shrimp."
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Shambavi K.,Cash only. carry out only (no dine in). All fried seafood.Their breading has a nice cornmeal crunch to it and it isn't too thick of a batter. Their jumbo shrimp is pretty jumbo. I think we got about 9 shrimp in the 1 pound jumbo bag. we also tried a half pound of fried oysters but this was passable as some bites were better than others. I'll probably return to try other items.
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,S J.,"I so wanted to love this shrimp.  The smell reminded me of Waukegan's Hilltop shrimp from back in the day, but sadly the breading was heavy and dense....and old. The catfish was a little spongy. My lunch was less than okay, and with all the yummy restaurants in Chicago, I probably would not revisit this spot."
goose-island-shrimp-house-chicago-chicago,Dianna Y.,"The best fish chips in the world.  Awesome prices.  Fish perfectly cooked,  batter perfectly seasoned and fries are great.  Shrimp is big and tasty.  Come here anytime im in town."
sushi-x-chicago,Erik Y.,"Another one of those places that I've enjoyed several times but haven't written a review. So, here it is:

Sushi X is a fun, cool sushi joint. It's BYOB, has a fun, upbeat atmosphere, and very welcoming. It's small-ish inside but it's perfect. Everyone is friendly and you can just relax while enjoying your meal. 

The food stands out. The sushi options are great as are the appetizers. My wife usually goes for one of their hot entrees, and they rock. I can't really knock anything here. 

As far as what we've ordered over the past couple years:

-Spicy miso soup
-Edamame
-Asian pot roast
-Seaweed salad
-All sorts of sushi

Everything is good!

I've also ordered delivery half a dozen times. It's always been accurate, fast, and tasty.

Whether you are BYOB-ing at the restaurant or having it delivered, it's probably my favorite sushi spot in Chicago!"
sushi-x-chicago,Sarah S.,"Back in town with a hankering for the sush, I ordered up a delivery feast. I hadn't had Sushi X before but had high hopes based on their positive reiews. 

Their gyoza was one of the best I've had in a long while! Steamed with some great black pepper seasoning then pan seared so just the right amount of barely-there-crisp. At $6 the price is right on this item and it didn't disappoint.

The Shitake mushroom roll ($5) was a bit weak. Small and a bit piddly and something just tasted a little off about it. Rolling was very weak and all over the place. Price was on point the roll? Not so much.

Lava Roll ($13) - Now I love the idea of Zero Rolls! They have a few to pick from that don't have any rice in them. This particular roll has spicy tuna, cream cheese, scallions inside then tempura deep fry dipper, topped with some eel sauce. Sounds great, right? It just didn't taste delicious to me. Spice level was just right though.

Honey Roll ($9) was another that sounded good in theory but it just didn't taste that great. White tuna and tempura flakes on the inside with a tiny bit of honey-sesame mayo on the outside. I don't know what happened but it it didn't work.

Now the Chocolate peanut butter Cup ($6) dessert was really good! It may be priced a dollar too high but it actually was a very rich and tasty dessert with excellent execution

Sixty dollars later, the best things of the meal were definitely my appetizer and the dessert. Honestly each of my rolls, something just seemed a little off. I love sushi and I wasn't clamoring to finish any of the rolls. Plus every item was a dollar or two too much. Meh. It's not terrible but far from the best I've had in town."
sushi-x-chicago,Emily H.,"Pretty good sushi place with a projector inside showing movies and good ambient. The sushi rolls are flavourful and fresh. They also have takeout here, I called a few times without anyone pick up, so I normally just go there directly, and they are pretty fast at making the rolls while I enjoy the movie."
sushi-x-chicago,Julie S.,"Sushi X rocks!

I came for dinner with a friend last night (Thursday) and we loved it. The place is small, but we had no problem getting a table. The staff was awesome (especially Brooke), and they weren't phased when we asked a million questions about the menu and the space. The colorful art and house music give the place great vibes. 

We ordered oyster shooters to start which were just the right amount of spicy. Then, we shared the yellow jacket, philly, and Godzilla rolls, which were all fresh, well presented, and delicious. Every month, a featured roll is 50% off. This month, it's the Godzilla roll. We somehow managed to make room for Mochi ice cream too. 

This place is BYOB (with no corkage fee), which is always appreciated, but I would come back here even if I had to pay for drinks."
sushi-x-chicago,Louise P.,Great sushi and the owner is there working! It's BYOB but the service and food make it worth your time and money. Go and you will be a believer too.
sushi-x-chicago,Erin M.,"Just moved to the neighborhood and I love this little spot! The sushi is delicious, the service is great, very cool ambiance and menu. They have great weekday specials sun-wed (i believe). Recently went in for their taco tuesday deal, delicious and so cheap!

They do roll of the month too which is awesome!"
sushi-x-chicago,Pete I.,This is the number 1 sushi spot in town. We've become regulars over the past year. Do NOT miss out!!
sushi-x-chicago,Shih C.,"What a little gem!  The restaurant is located right off of busy Milwaukee avenue and there were plenty of parking.   My friend had spicy miso soup which he said was awesome.  The seaweed salad... my goodness, it was so delicious!   We ordered Red Crush and Pollo Loco rolls to stuff our faces while my friend enjoyed his Spicy Tuna Salad and I had the Red Chicken.  Every item we ordered were superb.  

The waitresses were very friend and attentive.  The music was a little loud for my taste.  I did enjoy the visit.  I would definitely go again."
sushi-x-chicago,Kenya C.,"Had Sushi delivered to a bar I was at. Was impressed, I'm a HUGE sushi lover. There selections were unique. I was outdone by the octopus sushi which was simply amazing!"
sushi-x-chicago,H K.,"Finally getting around to writing a review after eating here several times.. This place doesn't disappoint, dine in- it's small, never had a problem getting a table, cute, fun, BYOB! Take out- has always been delish too! Friendly staff, great ambience, good food & BYOB"
sushi-x-chicago,Melissa J.,"Just moved in around the corner. We have lived here for two weeks and visited three times already- it is THAT GOOD! 

The restaurant itself is fairly small. They have lots of cool modern style art on the walls and a big screen projecting movies onto the wall. 

No alcohol- but BYOB and they will happily provide openers for your beverages. 

Food- all delicious! They have a wide variety of the traditional fare and even tacos! Each night there is a special so we usually change it up and order whatever is on special. One thing that sticks out in my mind as something you should definitely try is their Gyoza. Get the pork ones, pan fried. Perfection!

A lot of the rolls have sliced jalepeno in them which is entirely too hot for me- you can easily order without or just pick them out.

We have a baby, who is usually sleeping in her stroller and the staff is very kind/accommodating :)"
sushi-x-chicago,Mironda R.,"Sushi X is a cute BYOB space (re: cute means extra small and cozy). Your chances for quick seating are probably before 7 and after 9.  

We had a bumpy start upon arrival. Although we arrived before another couple, they were given the option of seating before us. Sadly, that caused us to be seated in front of the entrance although we had just previously shared we didn't want to sit there once the tables opened up.The problem was the staff must have had an out of body experience and forgot we were customers. One literally was like well they are seated already and her expression was so sit here or get lost. The other lady was trying to side with us because she knew we had been waiting but was getting nowhere with the other staff person. Eventually, they both came back and did a reset. They offered to move us once a table opened up and then closed the door for us when we opted to stay because I think we would have just left.

Once we were settled in, we were able to focus on the menu. The options were plentiful from a variety of starters to rice-less rolls (zero), to deconstructed bowls to a massive selection of rolls. I had the miso (spicy) and it was spicy! I appreciated it and it was quite sizeable! I then opted for the Japan-A-Wrap - it was interesting.. the cilantro and basil was overpowering and lacked texture. The fish was F R E S H! I then ordered the Spicy Tako a bit too much mayo, but again F R E S H! My friend ordered the megatron and it was huge!

Overall, I appreciate a new place with quality fish and BYOB."
sushi-x-chicago,Courtney H.,"Had some delicious sushi takeout from Sushi X through Yelp24...seaweed salad was delicious, pork gyoza (dumplings - YUM!) also amazing. The sushi itself was packed beautifully (which I always worry about with takeout). My only complaint was not getting the sauces (eel sauce, ponzu and sweet chili) that were described with the sushi on the menu. I wanted to give SushiX 5 stars, but was super sad as the missing sauces really took away from the meal."
sushi-x-chicago,Dan E.,"This place used to be great, but they keep raising prices and now they charge a $5.00 ""corkage"" fee for BYOB. Pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered."
sushi-x-chicago,Megan M.,"I've visited Sushi X twice during the week. It's rather small inside but I didn't experience an issue finding a table. They offer a monthly special roll - which means it is half price. 

Go for the Red Crush - it's one of my favorites. Also, it's BYOB!"
sushi-x-chicago,Dessi D.,"BYOB! No corkage fee. Cool art work...sushi is not bad. Try the roll of the month for half off. The owner is super polite and pleasant. The anime movie playing on the wall is an interesting addition. 50$ for 2 giant rolls, 1 rice on the outside and 2 sashimi ...not too crazy busy on a Saturday evening"
sushi-x-chicago,Ameer S.,"I was really looking forward to this place given all the great reviews and close proximity to me, but unfortunately, it was underwhelming. The sushi was mediocre at best. Maybe it was an off night? I would be willing to try them again in the near future."
sushi-x-chicago,Natasha C.,"Came here on a snowy night right around opening time and it was instant love. We weren't the only people in there for long as people trickled in (I'm sure on a non snowy day- it fills up faster).  The rolls are awesome. Love the lava roll the most. Service is good, servers are nice and really chill. Loved the ""final fantasy"" style anime movies playing (they may all be this style and I just don't know).  We did not have time for dessert but will on the next visit. 

The art work is divine. We simply had a great time and will be back.....soon."
sushi-x-chicago,Mary A.,"Visiting Chicago and was craving sushi.  There was non-metered street parking in front.  There is a large mural directly to the left of the front door- so you can't miss it driving by.  Showed up around 6pm on Sunday- there was only one other table seated.  One other party showed up while we were there.  Pretty low-key place.

Ordered edamame appetizer- served warm and salted.  Ordered the sashimi ""mini"" which comes with 6 pieces (2 each of 3 different types of fish).  Fish was generously sliced (larger than the rice underneath) but was slimier than it should have been.  Also ordered the rainbow roll and the spicy tuna roll.  Both were a huge let down.  The rainbow roll was covered in more avocado than fish.  The spicy tuna roll was bland.  Both rolls had rice that seemed undercooked- very crunchy.  Ugh, so disappointed."
sushi-x-chicago,Blake L.,"SushiX delivers a unique sushi experience and is definitely worth a try! What I love is when you are welcomed with a smile and friendly service. That is what you definitely get at SushiX as it is a petite sized restaurant with big time personality! We told the waitress this was our first time dining with them and she said we would get a free dessert (chocolate peanut butter which was delicious). Can I get a Hell yeah! 

Let's get to the important part of this review: the food. It is worth noting that this sushi spot is BYOB so come prepared with a couple bottles of wine. As far as the food- there are various options while not overwhelming you like a normal Thai restaurant menu. My girlfriend and I really liked how they offer salads and sushi bowls (similar to poke). We ordered tuna/salmon $6 rolls which are basic and how we like our sushi. We also enjoyed an ahi tuna salad ($9), beef bowl ($15), and I ate the whole shrimp gyoza dish ($6). As you can see everything is reasonably priced as we walked out very full for $80 total (tax and tip included). To quickly summarize, everything we ordered was delicious. The sushi is good but I liked the salad and beef bowl the best. You get a ton of raw tuna on the salad which for $9 is a bang for your buck. The beef bowl offer copious amounts of beef and is like a huge beef fried rice. I enjoyed the shrimp gyoza too as it was light & not fried. 

One piece of advice is that I would change the menu to read the normal way as everything is listed from back to the front. It reminded me of Hebrew and reading left to right.. The Waitress said they are making slight changes to the menu in a few weeks. I would keep the food items as they are, however, I would list apps and salads on the front. 

Thank you for a unique and great first experience at SushiX"
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Ryan H.,"Excellent dining experience!  One of my favorites.  Kendall college was recommended to me by a Chicago architectural tour guide, and we were not disappointed. Reservations are required. 

The hostess sat us immediately, and provided my wife (who was wearing black) with a black napkin.  That was a nice, thoughtful touch, which earned positive reinforcement from her instructor. 

3 choices of water, which is 3x more than I'm accustomed to (bottled, sparking, and tap).
 
I had a Moscow Mule, with bourban, lime, rosemary, and pineapple.  Very interesting and enjoyable. The rosemary provided a bit of additional interest.  

They served bread with butter. The sourdough was good; the dinner roll was delicious.  Bread is made fresh every afternoon. Somehow the butter (sprinkled with rock salt) seemed especially tasty.  

We were served a course of amuse bouche, which was nice.  

I'd ordered the salmon, but first briefly considered (aloud) getting the steak.  My server made an error and brought me the steak. However, i didn't mind that at all; I feel like it's all part of the learning experience at this culinary college.  The steak was excellent ."
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Shenna M.,"I really wanted to love it! 

The concept is amazing and I really enjoyed watching the students create and work but most things were just a tad off. 

Arrive for reservation and had a bit of a wait, was escorted upstairs to a half empty dinner service. 

Menu very different from Restaurant Week menu posted online and even then they ""ran out"" of two items on the much smaller than advertised menu. 

Long waits between courses and first offering of bread took way longer than it should have, though they seemed to be sufficiently staffed. 

The food: beautifully presented and acceptable flavor. The cook on the lamb and beef tenderloin were spot on. The dishes were just missing a tiny bit of oomph. 

The space is beautiful, with amazing views. The students are charming and thoughtful. 

I am looking forward to giving them another shot post-Restaurant Week!"
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Christine N.,"My husband and I absolutely love coming here for dinner. It's fine dining without the fine dining price tag! Each time we've gone, we've loved all of our dishes. 

The students are preparing your meal with an executive chef that oversees their work. So there's no need to be scared about what's going to come out of the kitchen.

The space is open with large windows that give you a beautiful view of the city. You also have a great view into the kitchen to see what the students are doing, and, from your point of view, the kitchen looks spotless! 

They do have a bar, and can serve you whatever you'd like! 

Their 3-course menu is only $22. Where can you go wrong with a price like that?!"
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Robert B.,"I had to really think about this review, and should I make it 1 star or 5 stars.

On the one hand, I could give this a 1 star review to try to keep people from coming here, to keep it all to myself.

On the other hand, I could be honest and give it a 5 star review, because...well, this place rocks!

I do love a nice fine-dining experience.  Not that I go to a lot of fine-dining restaurants.  Maybe once every 2 years or so.  But I've been to a few nice restaurants.  Really nice restaurants, in fact.  So I do have a frame of reference for a place like the Dining Room at Kendall College.

Let me give you the tl;dr version of this review: This place is amazing, especially given the price.

As others have mentioned, Kendall College is a culinary school.  The students have to do a rotation in the dining room as servers, bussers, wine servers, and cooks.  The servers are generally nervous.  But that's cool.  They're learning and we're helping them.  And man, they really try hard!  The cooks rock this shit.  The food is amazing.  No, seriously.  The kitchen is run by one of the faculty members who makes sure that the dishes meet the high standards, so you can count on the quality.

Why else should you go?  How about drink specials virtually every night?  Yep, Tuesday (I think) is half price wine bottles.  Yep!  And all of the tips you give go to providing scholarships to kids to get into the industry.

Anyway, I've been here twice and both times have been great.  Sure, the service is a bit awkward and imperfect.  But the food is 95% of what you would expect for a fine dining restaurant.  And the enthusiasm of the students and staff more than makes up for any slight shortcomings you might experience.  And even so, the price more than makes up for anything else.  And if nothing else, keep in mind that you are helping to educate really wonderful students!

So, after all this, I ended up making this a 5-star review, because they deserve it.  But you should go to a place in the loop instead, spend 4 times as much for 10% better service, and leave the Dining Room at Kendall College to me!"
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Suzy D.,"Great food for a great price. Get the special that includes a glass of wine. Went for lunch and had three courses for 22 dollars. Scallop appetizer was tasty but the cod entree was even better. The cod was perfectly cooked and delicious. The key lime pie dessert was good but I've had better. Plating was lovely. If you order cocktails and more drinks, it can start to add up, but that's true of any place. Student waiters were fine and tried hard. It was cool watching them learn how to remember who ordered what etc. It did take awhile to get the check and when it came we were charged for a few extra things so they corrected the bill. Not a huge deal but a minor annoyance. I would come back, but come when you're not in a rush. 

4 stars for food 
3 stars for service"
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Corey N.,"Recommended with some reservations.  The restaurant is part of Kendall College and it features a 3-course prix fixe for $29.  There are about 6 choices in each category of appetizer/main/dessert, so plenty of selections.  The food is good, if a bit inconsistent.  For example, steaks are not cooked to temperature and the kitchen turned out the same dish at the meal (cod) that and the portion size turned out very differently.  The room is subdued and somewhat quiet, but very comfortable for conversation.

While the food is fairly well-executed, the servers are students...and it shows.  There's a lack of polish in the dining room.  The wait staff are adequate, but they have no real clue about wine service.  The service tends to run slow too, which might be a function of the kitchen.

Certainly a great bargain and the free parking is a nice bonus.  However, best to set your expectations for service to a minimum."
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,William Y.,"The dishes got even a bit smaller than my last visit, but overall it was very good value. Food quality was not bad. Our group of 3 all had different dishes, and all dishes were good. Nothing too impressive or memorable but everything was nicely done. 

The student servers were a bit raw but trying very hard to impress. The dining room is not crowded at all, and people do not overhear each other."
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Angela D.,"Our prix fixe dinner Saturday night was a truly special dinner. We dined here for the first time for Restaurant Week and were so glad we did! Interestingly, we had dined at Naha the night before and Kendal blew them away in terms of flavor pairings and portion size.

We started with Mushroom Risotto / Parmesan Tuile / Huile d'Persil and the Wok Seared Scallop / Pumpkin Ravioli / Dashi Broth / Bonito / Togarashi Sichimi. They were both wonderful, but my scallop in dashi broth was the real standout - perfectly cooked, lovely broth, and the pumpkin ravioli was the best counterpoint. It was served with a tangy olive bread and sage-infused butter. An amuse-bouche of two veggie sushi bite kept us eager for more.

My Roast Chicken Piccata / Chives / Chives / Whipped Ricotta Sesame Grits / Capers / Yellow Squash Proven√ßal / Chicken Jus entree was amazing. Chicken Piccata sounds a little boring but this portion of breast and wing was tender, juicy, and alive with flavor. The grits were nice and creamy, but the yellow squash was a real surprise. It was in a sort of tomatoey agro-dolce sauce that I can't wait to recreate.

My husband has the Grilled Strip Loin / Chimmichurri / Curried Jasmine Rice / Pickled Ginger Salad / Romesco Sauce which was like a rave party of flavor! So much going on in the dish, but the tastes cooperated in making the dish exceptional.

For dessert, I was going to have bingsu but the Hazelnut Dark Chocolate Mousse / Dark Chocolate Mousse / Hazelnut Crunch / Orange Anglaise / Hazelnut Whipped Cream / Chocolate Cake won out. It was lovely as well as delicious. Joe had a peanut butter/bacon cheesecake with bananas and it was amazing. 

I can't believe we waited so long to visit this place. The dining room is comfortable and tranquil, with enormous windows showcasing the skyline to the south, and the windows into the kitchen let us enjoy watching the students hard at work. Service was impeccable and prompt. Around the dining room and some adjoining halls are displays of antique kitchen equipment which you really shouldn't miss seeing. On top of all that - free plentiful parking! We're big fans."
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Michael B.,"Wow, I've not been here in a while and forgot what a wonderful dining experience Kendall offers.  For $29, you get Wonderful three course meal with interesting menu choices, lovely plating and most importantly delicious food.  In between courses we're surprised with interesting palette cleansers and other chefs delight goodies.  The desserts were equally fabulous.  There is a $10, corkage if you bring your own wine.

The students whose turn it is to serve could not be more charming and delightful. 

There was not a dish that any of us ate, (and we all tried each other's food) that was not excellent.

Help the school, the students and enjoy a Wonderful meal and experience. Congrats to the professor overseeing the dining room experience for her and the team's professionalism and execution.

Can't wait to go back. Check out their Monday night dining program menu as well. Free parking."
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Karl B.,Best fine dining experience you can ever get for the lowest price ever...Chef Kang pours his soul into making sure the quality of the food surpasses your expectations
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Rachel W.,"My first experience here was a lot of fun. 

I chaperoned a group of senior citizens and we all really enjoyed ourselves. 

The salmon was divine (see photos) and the service was top-notch. 

I definitely recommend giving The Dining Room a try, especially if you're in the  neighborhood. Quality, execution and price can't be beat. 

Will be back!"
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Sandra May L.,"Opps, I meant to write this review a long time ago during restaurant week, but I have forgotten! terribly sorry, this place during restaurant week was awesome! Their meals and plating are extremely beautiful! It was definitely one of those...too pretty to eat type. Their menu has a variety of choices you can choose from. I also posted some of my photos from my experience. The best dish that i have tasted so far was the duck breast, the bone marrow dish, and the creme brulee. 

if anyone is thinking about doing restaurant week year, please add the dining hall to your list! great price and many different choices to choose from. for 4 people, it was $23 per person excluding tax and tips. The service was also very good and did not judge my friends and I when we were trying to take instagram photos of our meals. Definitely would love to come back at night with my significant other for a romantic dinner. They also have a wonderful view of outside and part of the city! There is also free parking.

Call to make reservations!"
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Ara H.,"Excellent experience. Went with a large party and we all had a really good time. The three course prix fixe menu was excellent, the wine choices were good and the hazelnut chocolate dessert was phenomenal. A few of our party had a second dessert. 

Also the prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food. 

A well deserved five stars. Will surely be back often."
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Mama M.,Every Chicago trip when school is in session I'll be here. A fun place to taste student work. The $18 prix fixe menu is a steal of a deal for the quality of food they put out.
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Care R.,"Woooooooowwwwwwwww
   Fantastic! I'm really glad we decided to try out the Kendall Dining Hall on trip to Chicago. I was very impressed with the food, the menu options, the plating, the flavors and the service. We tried a few different restaurants, places that kept coming up in TV shows and online guides ranging in price and I have to say this was my favorite place. There was great care in the overall experience and we were surprised that even in the top Chicago restaurants, the food and most notably the service was not as good as the students trying to earn their stripes. 
   I think any trip to Chicago merits a trip here."
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,David P.,"What a great venue and culinary experience!  A beautiful view of the loop with an open kitchen that is glassed, so you can see all your food being prepared.  Parking was easy, big parking lot with plenty of space.  It's right down the street from the theater district, which is great for a full evening out.  

As for the food, it was very good.  The menu was seasonal, creative and fun.  We started with an order of PEI Mussels braised in beer and fresh herbs served with micro greens and bread for dipping, yummy.  We then ordered the three course pre-fix menu.  It came with three course; appetizer, entree and a dessert for about $30.  This was a great value, considering the quality of ingredients and the professional classic French preparation.  

For my appetizer, I had the New York Strip Steak with Asparagus and Bernaise Sauce, which was awesome.  My son had the saut√©ed scallops with a carrot pur√©e and balsamic glaze, which was also very good.  For my entree, I had the Sea Bass with a wild mushroom broth that was incredible.  I really enjoyed the fish.  My son had the Salmon with a Thai Basil Pesto with candied carrots etc..  He's dinner was also very good, but I liked my Sea Bass better.  

As for dessert, I had the chocolate cake with pickled fennel and chocolate mousse.  My son had the carrot cake, I think?  It was also tasty...

All and all, just a great evening with a nice bottle of wine, great food with a fun venue.  I will be back!"
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Kevin N.,"The Dining Room at Kendall College is the best-kept foodie secret in Chicago. Located west on Chicago at Halsted, the building is right on the river. I have been dining here on special occasions for years. I even had my wedding party at Kendall for an elegant luncheon.

Here's why I love the place: it's fancy but very, very reasonable. The quality of the ingredients is top-notch. Most of the proteins and veggies are locally sourced. In fact, the menu lists the suppliers of everything from the foie gras to the lamb to the elk. They always have the finest foods on the menu: duck confit, sweetbreads, arctic char, short ribs. The variety is amazing. Kendall even offers vegetarian and vegan options. The preparations are stunningly beautiful and, nearly all of the time, incredibly delicious. The techniques are experimental. You will see cutting-edge preparations from molecular gastronomy to traditional French. It's right on par in taste and presentation with every prix fixe five star restaurant that I've ever visited. 

You will typically get a complimentary amuse bouche with your meal, even at lunch. Sometimes you get free intermezzo courses. For my celebration last night, I had an extra dessert delivered to the table with Happy Anniversary piped across the rim of the plate in decadent rich dark chocolate. 

Kendall is also byob! While there is a very nice wine, beer and cocktail menu, bring your own bottle and enjoy it for a $10 corking fee.

This is a school, so that's why the prices are so low. Right now, a three course dinner is $29pp. Lunch is even less. As for the service, it attempts to mimic the finest restaurants. It's there most of the time. The servers are earnest and passionate, but they don't have years of experience behind them. It can be a bit tentative, but it's never unacceptable. While the taste, presentation, and creativity of the food gets a solid 95% from me, I'd give the service an 85%. The value is 300%, because you can't find a Michelin-mentioned, white table cloth restaurant with these amazing views of the city, free parking, and a glass wall to see into the kitchen while your food is prepared for anything less than $90 a person.

There are little extras here too that add additional value. How about a tray of mini cookies and candies with your tab? The handmade, artisanal lollipops to take away after dinner: delicious. I use the Open Table app to make reservations here. It's not open all year around. It's available when classes are in session in the late summer to early winter and then again in spring. 

I love the Dining Room at Kendall College. It's amazing. I cannot recommend it enough."
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Cindy W.,"Had a wonderful experience here with a friend! It's a really good value for the quality you're getting. The environment is a bit simple but for 3 courses + a glass of wine for $22 -- that really can't be beat. 

I really enjoyed the fettuccine appetizer - made from scratch. It was savory and the noodles had a great texture. I wasn't impressed with my friend's calimari appetizer since the greens didn't really go well. For the main course, I ordered the sea bass and my friend got the steak. While the steak looked visually appealing, both our entrees were a bit undersalted.

We loved our desserts, and I was partial to my friend's sponge cake with cream on top. Seriously, a lovelyyyy dessert. 

I would definitely come back again. Our waitress was nice and our overall dining experience was truly pleasant!"
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Maisha R.,"Cooking school restaurants offer a great opportunity to try high end food at very reasonable prices while participating in the students' learning experience.

We had a reservation for early on a Friday night.  When we arrived, half of the restaurant was set up for a party, so we got great seats near the kitchen where we could see the students preparing the food under the watchful eye of the head chef. We started with a non-alcoholic beverage, a pomosa, which was composed of pear nectar, pom juice, lemon juice, and non-alcoholic champagne ($4). The pre fixe meal ($29) included an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  There were both regular and special menu items from which we could choose.  

Our meal incuded:
Bread - focaccia, french loaf with herbs, croissant, dinner roll, beet herb butter

Amuse bouche - brulee apple, mint goat cheese 

Appetizers 
- warm beets, basil goat cheese, mache
- seared scallop, maple-soy reduction, roasted baby carrots

Entrees 
- ale braised bison short rib, house made crouton, baby spinach, roasted root vegetable, braising jus
- arctic char, thai basil pesto, roasted root vegetable wild rice, swiss chard

Desserts
- rhubarb and tomato: darjeerling poached rhubarb, tomato jam, house made mozzarella cheese croquette, tomato waffles, rhubarb tomato sorbet
- strawberry and cream: strawberry may wine parfait, slow roasted strawberries, may wine gelee, cajeta ice cream, asparagus sponge cake

The bread was addictive - warm, soft, fresh, and flavorful. Thankfully, the bread was in abundance. The appetizer portions were small and while there was a technical difficulty with the short rib as it was very tough, they were able to capture really great flavors with the dishes. We found the dessert menu very odd with tomato waffles, buckwheat thyme blintzes, sweet pea yoghurt snow cake, beet sponge and beet mousse, and a black sesame souffle. Honestly, neither of us really wanted any of the dessert options and we weren't pleased with what we ordered. Savory desserts are not my idea of a good ending to a meal.

The hospitality was excellent. The student hosts, waiters, and waitresses were personable and helpful, offering suggestions and recommendations. Overall, we enjoyed the experience and the students did a really great job. Our comments were requested by a card on the table, which will be taken into account for the students' grades."
kendall-college-the-dining-room-chicago,Yvon B.,"My girlfriend and I went for lunch with the prix fix menu $18 for a 3 course lunch.,.3 courses of high quality well thought out with a touch of old school French cuisine. Where do you get that in town? Nice quite room and beautiful tablecloth. The kitchen is blocked by a glass wall and you can see the action and how impeccable this kitchen is. 
We had the smoke trout with pumpernickel bread, which was crumbled in tiny pieces and I guess buttered, baby beets, delicious. The salmon quenelle with butter sauce reminded me of France, made with a panade, fantastic. The asparagus soup was very silky, and the lamb chops with spring vegetables delicious. I had the pressed pork, it was good, but a bit dry. 
Desserts were great as well, chocolate tart with peanut butter ice cream, and a carrot cake with pistachio and pineapple sorbet with a very small diced mango.
Presentation is top notch, service is very professional and friendly, food is just incredible. I mean 18 bucks, really?
The use of seasonal vegetables is something I particularly enjoy, asparagus, baby beets, turnips, fava beans were all cooked to perfection.

I think the school closes during summer, so I will be going next week again, twice probably.
Remember folks it is a school, so tiny flaws can be expected, but it is a great school and you will enjoy every moment, I promise.
Next time I'll take pictures, my girl and I were to busy contemplating the excellence of what $18 just got us

Enjoy!!!"
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Thomas Y.,"My favorite pizza joint in Chicago. 

They serve thin crust, Neapolitan style pizza. Tried a bunch of their specialty pizzas and you can't go wrong with any of them. I've been come to this place for years and still stands up against the test of time and other competitors."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Diana G.,"The crust and whipped ricotta are top notch so definitely get the ricotta if you can. The only problem is pick minimal toppings as the middle starts to get too thin and soggy, or maybe it just needed to be cooked longer.

We did a create your own with spinach and tomatoes and whipped ricotta which might have been too many toppings. Still so delicious.

Service was a little pushy, kept asking us if we wanted more beers after messing up a beer order. But wasn't a deal breaker for a next visit!"
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Gorman B.,"Right off the bat let me state that I am a New Haven pizza snob.  Sally's, Pepe's and Modern are the only real pizza places in the U.S.  Period.  End of story.

That said, I was pleasantly surprised by Coalfire.  Chicago is a town I've previously felt sorry for.  99.9% of the pizza is laughable.  (Piece Pizza being the one exception because it's owner gets it, and understands the only real pizza is in New Haven.)

Ordering the margherita pie (if you can't do a cheese pie right, you should NOT be making pizza), I was delighted by the lightly charred crust what was wonderfully chewy.  The cheese and sauce were near perfect.  Salty, tangy, someone here knows what they're doing.

It's nothing like New Haven pizza, but I would say it's one of the best New York-style pies I've ever tasted.  

The joint is small but cool.  Service was great.  Nice beer selection.  The other pies we sampled were all equally tasty.  I would return next time I'm in town.  

With Piece and Coalfire I'm now going to have to stop saying I feel sorry for the pizza-deprived people of Chicago.  Savor these pies!

Bravo!"
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Michele O.,"My review is based on the insulting experience had by my friend on her birthday visit, 11/18/17. I am appalled that customer service has fallen to such a low level.
Was just verbally accosted by the owner for asking why my friends had to stand in the cold while we waited for a table in his HALF EMPTY restaurant. After being yelled at inside of the restaurant I told him we would leave. He followed me outside to berate me even as I was walking away from the establishment he continued yelling at me & my guests.  Please share. (via Julisa V.)
I stand with you to say NO to poor customer service. The stresses of the world are enough, so when you go somewhere to unwind the expectation is not to be insulted or berated. Again, Julisa, I STAND WITH YOU."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Emma B.,"This is a review for take-out. All I can say is, soggy pizza bottoms and not much flavor. The side salad was also underwhelming. The ricotta whip was okay though. There are so many non-deep dish pizza places in the city, so I think I'll try somewhere else next time."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Dustin B.,Favorite restaurant in the city! Pepperoni and whipped ricotta is a must order! Margherita pizza was delicious too. Friendly staff and great neighborhood feel.
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Christina S.,"I somewhat enjoyed the pepperoni, cheese, and ricotta pizza despite the fact that the edge of the crust was a bit on the burned side.  As I ordered delivery they put the ricotta on the side to scoop on yourself so the flavors did not really blend as I imagined they would when cooked together. The pizza sauce was quite bland; however, the pepperoni was stellar!  

It was good to try a new pizza place-but I am not sure that I would order from here again.

The salad with radishes and herbed vinaigrette was a substantial size and very fresh."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Kunal C.,"Optimally charred and bubbly, thinnnnn crust pizza from Coal-fire! Been there a bunch of time now, and want to warn the pizza lovers out there- definitely go with your stomach empty. I personally like to dine in as compared to carry out as it's obvious why.. 

My personal fav- Pepperoni and whipped ricotta Pizza, and two of them for me please. However, other pizzas, almost all of them are delicious. 
The pesto pizza is a bit sweeter as I believe it contains honey. Personally, not a big fan of the sweet taste on my pizza, but I'm sure it's worth a try. Lots of other options available for sausage and meat lovers, as well as multiple options available for vegetarian friends.. you can also build your own customized pizza. 

What else, Beer? They got a decent collection of beer and wine. I once took my friend here on his birthday and they brought a cute lil cupcake with a candle for him. 

Always experienced good customer service."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Rebecca M.,"If you're in the mood for thin crust pizza and great service, this is the place for you!

The pepperoni and whipped ricotta pizza is really good, and the one pizza was enough to feed two people plus leftovers. Service was quick, and since we came early to beat the crowds we were in and out in under an hour!"
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Tony P.,"Every time I visit Chicago, I make this a dinner stop.  They consistently change out their pizza options by season and on this visit we were fortunate to have the heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad appetizer.  The tomatoes were rich with flavor and the mozzarella was firm without being stingy or over worked.

We had the Vodka Meatball pizza and the toppings were disbursed evenly, the crust was cooked with a thin crisp crust and the basil was very fresh.  I always enjoy the adventure of new Neapolitan style pizza when I visit this location."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Sandra C.,"Amazing amazing pizza! They have the most fabulous tasting pizza I have ever had.  Service is fast.  They only have beer and wine, wish they had some liquor.  Best fancy tasting pizza in Chicago.  Yum lasagne pizza and honey and salami!!"
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Jennifer P.,"I kind of have a soft spot for Coalfire: not just because I enjoy coal fired pizza (duh), but because my +1 and I had one of our first dates here several years ago.

We went during the week, so it was a LOT less busy! Service was friendly and speedy. My water glass was filled (twice!) before I got past the halfway point. My only complaint is that there was a bunch of oil on the table under the condiments. blech.

I wish they had apps on their menu (I only saw salad, which IMO just doesn't qualify). We went straight for the pizza: the White, which was my favorite in NYC.

It was pretty good: I loved the fresh basil leaves. There were HUGE dollops of ricotta.. maybe too huge? You really have to eat the white while it's piping hot, or else the taste and texture are kind of ""meh.""

I don't think we'd get the White again in the future, but am glad we tried it anyway. You can't go wrong with the Margherita!

On the night we were there, they ended up giving out complimentary slices of pie with the check! It was so nice! We (I) got cheesecake. It was just okay...Hey, I can't complain about free dessert!"
coalfire-pizza-chicago,MaryLou L.,"Second time to try this pizzeria- First time was during winter and there was a long wait to get a table but nonetheless the enduja was worth it. 
This time around, we tried the meatballs and it too was great. I would probably come back but it isn't in my neighborhood and there are a lot more neopolitan, new haven pizzas out there to try."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Kristy D.,"I came here last night around 7pm (a Friday night) and we only waited about 5 minutes before being seated. It wasn't too cold outside, so we didn't mind standing next to the outdoor heater while waiting. However, this might be something to consider if you're coming on an especially cold night or have a baby in tow. 

We order two glasses of Chianti and the nduja pizza. Since so many yelpers raved about the whipped ricotta and I admittedly wanted the enviable pictures for social media, I made sure that I ordered a pizza with those beautiful dollops. In asking our waitress to make sure, she let us know that the nduja no longer came with whipped ricotta so we added that on for an extra $2. The pizza was fantastic. I loved the chewy crust and the nduja sausage for something a little different. Because it's a spreadable sausage, I mixed it with the ricotta to get that even distribution of flavor. I liked that they also offer a chili oil as a condiment, which we definitely made use of. 

I find that this pizza is pretty comparable to Paulie Gee's in Logan Square, although this is a bit pricier. We paid $43 prior to tip. Neighborhood parking wasn't too difficult to find."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Rose M.,"Nice pizza place to go with friends to try the different pizzas. They come out super fast. Great atmosphere and energy. I wouldn't say their pizza is the best but it's good. We were a party of five and ordered four pizzas and had no leftovers. The vodka sauce pizza was definitely our favorite. Overall pizza is just a little better than ok but a great place to go with friends because of the experience, pizza and drinks without having to go all out."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,James T.,"It can be hard to predict on any given day if there will be a wait here, but don't be surprised if there's a wait on weekends and at night, especially for parties of more than 4 people.

The drink menu contains a good variety of beers, especially for a pizzeria (pizza pubs don't count!). The house salad is standard, but I would recommend getting the Caesar salad which goes along with the pizza better. The salads are priced around $9 +/-, while the pies range from $17 to $20.

The pizzas are very tasty and are LOADED with whatever toppings you order. They come out of an 800¬∞ oven, so of course they're too hot to touch right away but the pies cool down quickly thanks to the thinness of the crust. The thin crust also helps the cheese, sauce, and toppings to really shine. Just know that depending on the toppings, you may find some of the pizzas to be a bit salty - in my case it was the sausage stracciatella. This put me on the fence on whether or not to subtract one star from the rating, but on second thought I do appreciate the place being generous with their toppings, especially considering that the pies are on the pricier side. Thus I am giving Coalfire 4.5 out of 5 stars, which rounds up to 5 stars.

Note that according to the menu, one pie is recommended to feed two people, but I believe that this recommendation was made based on the assumption that you will also order some salad and dessert. Otherwise half of a pie per person won't be enough to fill up an average stomach."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Reda K.,"Pizza here is great. Great location
 The only thing I didn't like was I'm a mix drinker and the only thing they have is beer in the bottle."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Abrawham H.,One of my new favorite pizza spots in Chicago!!! The pizza was baked to perfection. The atmosphere was laid back plus great customer service. Definitely wud recommend to a friend.
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Yan V.,"My SO and I came here on a Saturday around 5 to try to avoid the lines as we heard it gets pretty crazy around peak times. We lucked out. We were seated immediately, and got our pizza ridiculously fast after ordering it!

The reason the pizzas can come out so fast is that they are baked in a coal fire oven. The thin dough get charred and delicious in just a few short minutes. Their differentiator is the dollops of whipped ricotta that they put on top of the pizza once it's out of the oven. This pizza is really delicious and the ricotta adds a nice creaminess and interesting texture combo to the top.

We both really liked the pepperoni and whipped ricotta pizza we ordered and would definitely come back. This pizza isn't piled high with toppings and cheese like some other pizza places, but the charred dough, thick cut pepperoni, and whipped ricotta make this a strong contender in Chicago's super competitive pizza scene."
coalfire-pizza-chicago,Consumer N.,"I love the pizza but it's so loud and cramped; I can't hear myself think about what to get from the extremely limited menu that pretty only tells you to order, eat and the fuck out! I love the pistachio pesto pizza but I'm never going back to this location for dine in, unless I'm getting just pizza for takeout. My experience there was one to never want again. The Southport location is best and the not only does the menu have more options to compliment your pizza but it has a full bar and great service as well! They'll be getting all the stars. Sorry, not sorry."
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Ulric H.,"Got a reservation here for a Monday evening with a friend from out of town who was in the mood for Italian.  Piccolo Sogno did not disappoint!

Our waiter was knowledgeable about every menu item and wine on the menu, describing it in ways that just got me excited to eat!  

We ordered the grilled seafood appetizer the triangle pasta special and the pappardelle boar ragu.

The seafood was cooked perfectly with all the shrimp and squid being super tender.  The pappardelle was a perfect texture and the boar delicious. 

I've only been here once before and it was a few years ago.  I'm so glad I thought to come here on an otherwise dreary weather Monday evening.  It will definitely be sooner rather than later this time around!"
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Quin T.,"What a nice hidden River North gem! Piccolo has been around for years even amidst the turnover rate of a few restaurants in the area. 
Upon entering, the restaurant is a lot larger than you would expect and the lighting is perfect! The patio looks amazing and I have heard that it's a great place to hangout during the summer months.
We were celebrating a friends birthday with a total of 14 people and Piccolo was gracious enough not to make us choose from a pre selected menu, they did not add gratuity to the bill, and they also allowed us to bring our own cake without charging us a fee! We called several places during the planning phase and some of their fees and demands were just ridiculous. 
The staff was amazing! With such a large party, PS made sure we had a couple of waiters at our disposal. We never felt rushed..even when a few members of our party arrived 30 minutes late. They even obliged us with many photos to include allowing us to take photos on the patio despite the 25 degree temp.
For starters, we had the griglia mista which was superb! We also had the frittura di calamari and it too was very good. A few of us had the caprese and cavolo nero salads, again very tasty.
For our main courses, we went with a few selections from their seasonal menu as well as the gnocchi from the regular menu. All of the pasta was fantastic and none of us left feeling stuffed which is the way it should be if you are consuming fresh made pasta. 
We really had a wonderful time and I am looking forward to summer days on the patio."
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Alice W.,"My boyfriend took me here for a surprise Valentine's Day dinner, and I thoroughly enjoyed our experience from the ambiance, service, to the food. 
We were promptly seated, given a bread basket, and menus. Our waiter gave us excellent recommendations for wine (and thankfully didn't question or make fun of my lack of knowledge of wine) and was very attentive to our every need.
We ordered the spaghetti neri and funghi pizza, and the staff graciously split everything onto two plates so we didn't have to do the divide on our own. The pizza was wonderful: thin, crunchy crust with flavorful and pungent cheese and truffle. At first I thought the truffle was a little overwhelming, but I found the more I ate, the more I got into and enjoyed it. The star of the show was the spaghetti neri. I've never had black squid spaghetti, but it was amazing!! The seafood paired with it was excellent, and our plates were both quickly empty.
I would highly recommend Piccolo Sogno for your next fancy dinner date, with your S/O, friends, or family."
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Kevin H.,We had a work event here so the menu was Set already. First off the bread is good but the olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette is out of this world. They have a very good wine selection and the staff waiting on you are really top notch. I thought the food was good and I have no complaints I would like to eat from a full menu and make my own choices at some point in time so I can only go on what was on menu.
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Mark C.,"After months of listening to other people rave about this place, I unfortunately can't join in on the expressions of love.  Began by being seated in a small room that was pretty loud with people very close by.  I understand when you have popularity, you want to cram in as many as possible but it does affect the experience.  The server came by and our table of 5 couldn't understand what he was saying regarding the specials and he had to walk around to both sides of the table for us to hear and even then, I couldn't understand everything he was saying.  

They have a substantial wine list so had a bottle of wine and before that, a Belvedere Martini (and yes, they have Blue Cheese olives like every decent place should).  It was restaurant week, so we went with their 3 course menu for $33.  (Basically, this is all just selected items on their regular menu as opposed to special dishes made for restaurant week.)

Started with the Caprese Salad.  I wanted the mixed greens (whatever creative name it was called) but it had Goat Cheese and for some reason, I was cut off when I asked for a different cheese.  Really?  I get the whole ""no substitutions"" rule on most items but cheese on a salad?  Not impressed with their inflexibility.

Main Course.  I had the Wild Boar and Pappardelle Ragu and the Short Ribs (2 of us split these).  I wish I just had the Wild Boar because the Short Ribs were really dry.  

Dessert. 
MOUSSE DI CIOCCOLATO or Chocolate Mousse with Raspberry.  Decent but nothing out of the ordinary.  Those who had the Panna Cotta weren't as happy.  

The portions are small, and that's fine, but with the premium prices, would expect more in terms of quality.  And the server was really bland and seemed overwhelmed with the number of tables he had.  Sometimes, you get someone with a great personality that makes you forget mediocrity.  This was not one of those times."
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Melissa B.,"My husband surprised me with reservations on Valentine's Day. We were excited as he has been wanting to try this restaurant for years. 

Being Valentine's Day, the restaurant was filled with tables of two and man, do they have you crammed in! We were so close to the people next to us we could hear their whole conversations and it was so hard to talk to my husband or even hear the server. The conversation between the couple next to us was not something I wanted to hear over my valentines dinner, I will just say that! It just seemed they were trying to optimize their covers over giving people a nice atmosphere to have dinner in. We also tried to order our appetizer before we ordered our entrees and our server made us order all at once because ""it helped the kitchen space the meal out"" which really made them turn tables faster than let people enjoy their Valentine's dinner. 

The food though, was delicious! We started with the calamari which was really great but lacked marinara sauce (I know, Americans over here). I had the ravioli stuffed with crab meat which was a special and that was amazing. My husband had black spaghetti with sea food which was also very good! We felt it was perfect portion sizes. We were full but didn't have left overs. We had the thousand layer dessert which was not what I was expecting but still good. 

Overall, the food is very good but I would suggest going on a less busy night to really be able to enjoy the meal."
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Tim K.,Met here for a client meeting and there were several good options that we ordered but I took the Diavolo pizza which was thin and enough for lunch. Great focaccia bread to start and a double espresso to close out lunch. I'd definitely come back.
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Kiryat D.,"One of my favorite Italian restaurants in the city of Chicago.

Incredible al-fresco dining during nice weather."
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Emma B.,"My husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner. The patio seating is AMAZING! One of the best outdoor seating options out there! Of course, we got seated at probably the worst table outside, but I don't hold that against them...someone's gotta get the crappy table, right? 

I wish the food was just as good as the ambience. But unfortunately that was not my experience. You can tell everything is thoughtfully made and made with care, but I just didn't think the flavors came through at all. I wasn't a big fan of the calamari starter, although perhaps I'm the odd one out because it looked like every table was ordering them. I had one of the pasta dishes (I added shrimp to it as well). The pasta sauce was just ok. But I loved the different textures and thought the shrimp were well cooked. My husband had the short rib with polenta. I tried the polenta and just didn't like it at all. He liked the short rib (I can't comment because I'm vegetarian). We ended our meal with ricotta cheesecake which was good. They had a really large wine selection, so if that's your thing, you might like the place!

I had a nice time with my husband, but I don't think we would come back. I wasn't impressed by the food. It's a shame because the outdoor seating is so amazing!"
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Neha P.,"This is a very nice restaurant that I visited while on vacation. It was a pleasant evening so we agreed to be seated in the back, outdoors. It was a great decision! The ambiance was beautiful and elevated the meal itself. If the weather is nice and you are able to get a reservation, definitely outdoor seating is recommended.

I thought the ambiance, service, and wine list was great. They have plenty of staff and helpers to get your orders, refill your waters, and attend to any needs you have. It's a great place to relax, have some wine, and enjoy with friends and family.

The food itself is good, but not great. For an Italian restaurant they do have a good menu with a variety of pasta and meat options. However we weren't taken aback with the flavor profiles of the meals. The pasta itself is fresh and cooked thoughtfully, but I just felt the flavors didn't jump out at you. Considering the prices, that raises the bar even higher for them to meet.

overall you are paying for the ambiance and the atmosphere. The food alone is not necessarily worth the cost, but it isn't bad. Combined with the outdoor seating, staff, and wine list, it is still a very worthy place to go for a nice Italian dinner"
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Refael Hai S.,"Came here with my wife for the restaurant week. They offer a smaller menu and you can pick your appetizer , main course and dessert. The options to pick from were great , and food was awesome! The only reason I didn't give this place .... 5 stars , the service was ok. For my opinion lil bit too slow. 
I would go there again and hopefully this time service will be bit faster."
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Isha D.,"I was actually super excited to check out this place, but am a bit disappointed. Our reservations were for 9:00pm; however, 20 minutes later I approached the guy who was checking people in and asked when we would get our table. His response to me was: we are just seating our 8:30 reservation. Yet, there were 3 tables opened right in front me.. so I was a bit confused. He also failed to apologize to us for our longer wait time nor did he offer us a seat at the bar. As far as the food, it's okay. I've honestly had better Italian food. I ordered some mushroom special with black truffle they had that day. Probably won't be back again."
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Stephanie P.,"Everything always tastes better when you're on vacation. I was visiting Chicago for the marathon and boyfriend made a reservation here for our celebratory post-race meal after it was highly recommended by his professor. She said it could not be missed and insisted we request to sit on the patio--I have to say she was right on both accounts.

We visited on a Sunday evening and boyfriend thoughtfully made a 7p reservation in advance, which is definitely recommended because while the restaurant wasn't full inside, the outdoor patio was fully seated. We were promptly seated upon arrival and started perusing their autumn dinner menu.

For the wine connoisseurs, the wine list they've curated here is extensive and surveys Italy's 20 wine regions quite well. It can be a little overwhelming if you didn't get a chance to look it over before dinner but the wait staff is more than happy to offer recommendations. I didn't think to ask for the sommelier but from the looks of the menu it's very likely one might be available to answer questions. 

The autumn menu highlights a lot of in-season produce so I settled on the Cappellacci Di Zucca (local squash, amaretto cookie stuffed pasta, brown butter, sage, walnuts) and boyfriend ordered the Tagliolini Di Castagna (chestnut flour pasta, wild mushrooms, garlic, shaved parmesan). The Cappellacci was AMAZING and honestly it was likely because this is the BEST version of brown butter that I've ever had. It was perfect. The Tagliolini was also very good; the wild mushrooms added a lot of depth of flavor. We also each ordered a glass of wine  by recommendation to pair with our dishes but I can't for the life of me remember what they were! Per the reviews on Yelp, we passed on dessert.

Our experience at Piccolo was warm and romantic from start to finish. I would definitely recommend this as one of the best restaurants in Chicago."
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Sam L.,"Piccolo Sogno: The personification of amazing Italian food found in America. 
Don't be turned away by the bustling business of this establishment, yes it is a lot of seating and when we were there (a Saturday night) it was bound to busy, still we had no problem getting a last minute reservation. Granted, our authentic Italiano last name MAY have had an impact on our getting such an ideal reservation and perfect table location but what can I say, we Italians know what we are doing. 
I knew it was bound to be a great experience when our waiter came and had a thick Italian accent, that's how it should be since we are at an Italian restaurant! Appetizers didn't disappoint, and neither did the entrees. 
Overall this was an amazing authentic Italian restaurant experience and I highly recommend it for the food, service and atmosphere."
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Bridget A.,"One of the only good things about this place is the patio in warmer months. I went for dinner and sat inside and it was not a great experience. It's so crowded with so many tables, which does not provide an intimate atmosphere. The service was good. The pasta was just not good at all. The gnocchi dish had tough shredded chicken breast and very basic vegetables in it. Very low quality and did not taste good. The server thankfully took it off the bill when we said we didn't like it. The ravioli was also not very good. 

Overall, for a place with $19-$24 pasta dishes, I was expecting better food."
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Mark J.,"Super service in an inviting environment makes for a great experience and a really good dinner. We had the grilled octopus, calamari and shrimp appetizer which was really tasty. Followed by the fresh pasta with wild mushrooms which was delicious. All of this accompanied by a couple of glasses of Primitivo which was so good! The waiters are awesome and really attentive. Will definitely be back to try more here."
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Tazeen L.,"Was in need of a big bowl of pasta to warm me up on a cold rainy night and this place totally delivered... 

Came in and was quickly seated with a basket of bread (the focaccia was my favorite) while perusing the menu..  Had the paglia which was ribbon pasta with veal ragu and it totally hit the spot.  Friends had the spaghetti nero and we all were part of the clean plate club despite the large portions... 

Desserts were a hit and miss, hit was the chocolate cake- standard lava cake but well executed and how do you go wrong with warm cake? The ricotta cheesecake was a miss, cold with a hard almost dense cake like consistency.  The berries it came with were good though... 

Overall most of the food was satisfying and the service was great too, would definitely drop by again"
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Sylvia P.,"Decided on celebrating our 3 year anniversary here a few weeks back and it was such a wonderful experience from start to finish. 

First of all, they have the most adorable, romantic outdoor patio. Very spacious with cute string lights.The inside is equally as beautiful with chandeliers and dim lighting. 

 Our server was extremely knowledgeable and professional, describing and suggesting food items. We decided on sharing  a grilled calamari as a starter and I had the Sapore di mare as an entree. Let's just say I probably crave these two a few times a month ( thank God I just had calamari last night and ate  seafood every day of my San Francisco vacation last week!)Seriously mouth watering food here! 

Overall the experience was top notch  and we both look forward to another night on their gorgeous patio  hopefully before this wonderful weather is gone."
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Xuan M.,"I've passed by this place many times and have heard good things about it. And recently i was taken here on a date :P

My boyfriend and I came on Valentines day this year. Reservation was a little hard to get, for how late we came (8:30 PM), it was still extremely busy.

We waited about 15 mins on top of having a reservation, and were seated in a not so glamorous spot, aka next to the bathroom. 

But everything was forgiven once the food came in. I got the lobster risotto to start, which I know was quite unconventional for a starter dish, but I had to. I love Italian food and I love risotto!! It was so rich in flavors and extremely delicious. My boyfriend's minestrone was great too! 

For entree I went with the classic Italian ragu, and it was once again mind blowing. So rich in flavors, and loved loved loved the texture of the noodles. My boyfriend's seafood spaghetti was also extremely delicious.

Service was great! We kept getting fancy bottled waters refilled :P Loved the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff. 

Also just an extra cute thing, they gave all the ladies red roses since it was valentines day.

The total came out to be $170, which was expensive, but for the quality of the food, it was worth  it. Will definitely come back again :P"
piccolo-sogno-chicago,Shanti I.,"I had heard great things about this place and was very excited to try it.  The outdoor patio is gorgeous, romantic, and perfect for a date night or a night out with your friends.  The vine/greenery is very charming back there.  It was a very pleasant ambience. The service was great on all fronts as well.  The host was kind and our server/bussers were very kind and helpful.  The manager also seemed very nice and friendly.  I know some of the other reviewers mentioned how there were snobby vibes here but I guess I didn't really pick up on it being snobbier here than at other nice places in the West Loop area.  Some people were dressed up and I was happy for them, why not?

The bread and olive oil/balsamic that they bring out in the beginning is delightful.  I love balsamic so much and it's so nice that it is part of the meal.  They also have an excellent wine menu!  They have bottles of wine for $30 so it is actually affordable to have a bottle of wine here if more than one person is going to drink wine.  We split a bottle of rose, which was absolutely perfect for a warm summer night in September.  And it was nicely chilled right by us.

The menu options are not really vegetarian friendly and are kind of pescatarian friendly but lots of dishes that seem pescatarian have bacon or pancetta.  The menu online is not the same menu that they had when we went there Friday night so we had less options than expected.    We started off with the Caprese salad and it was light and refreshing.  The buffalo mozzarella had a strong, intense flavor that went so well with the light olive oil and basil on it.  The tomato was slightly roasted and it tasted a bit smoky with the mozzarella.  It was a perfect way to start the meal.  For our entrees we got the Ravioli Piccolo Sogno and the Salmon.  The ravioli was my favorite.  The ravioli was a four cheese ravioli in a butter sauce with pine nuts and parmesan on top.  The sauce was heavenly and the marsala was subtle and went really well with the more savory flavors of the butter and pine nuts.  The pine nuts added a nice crunchy texture to the al dente ravioli. 

 The salmon was a little underwhelming though.  Like I said before, we didn't have too many options as pescatarians because the other fish dishes had pancetta in it.  The salmon was really well made but it was kind of on the bland side and not very flavorful.  There was a light, subtle garlic sauce with carrots and corn served with the salmon.  It tasted good but it needed to be more exciting since the salmon was kind of boring.  

We concluded our meal with an amazing dessert though.  It was this layered flaky pastry with a chocolate chip cream sauce in between each layer and a vanilla bean whipped cream served on the side.  The vanilla bean whipped cream was fluffy and light.  I absolutely loved it."
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Shruti S.,"It's brightly decorated, almost like if you were outside. It's also brightly lit. It was empty except a group of four people when I visited. Lots of choices, not being super hungry I went for empanadas and yucca fries. Chicken empanadas were great, the cheese and guava one was weird which I knew but still wanted to try. The yucca fries, meh. My friend said her steak was really good. No drinks though so that's a bummer."
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Susan P.,"Had dinner on Saturday night and it was almost completely empty... I shouldn't had a clue then but I was too hungry to care then.


We ordered the combination app which was fine nothing super exciting (all deep fried), and we got the carne asada and the shrimp in the Cuban creole sauce. I read a lot of the reviews regarding small portions but I surely thought, how small could it be?!? Oh let me tell u... our shrimp dish cost something like $20 and there were a total of 6 shrimp (I counted all the tails cuz I'm petty ). The carne flavor was ok, but the portion was also tiny! 

I will never go to this place, the portions are tiny and the food wasn't that good."
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Shambavi K.,"Hubby and i came here for friday dinner. The food was not impressive and the prices were overpriced for the quantity and quality. The carne asada was literally 3 millimeters thick...not a good example of a steak. Fish with garlic sauce wasn't what i expected...felt like something i would throw together at home. The empanadas were just okay tho. We tried the spinach/cheese and the beef.

Cute place with moderate decor. The staff was very friendly."
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Amy A.,"One of my favorite spots in the neighborhood. Empanadas (guava and cheese, spinach and cheese and chicken, and fried plantains are my favorite. The prices are good and service has always been fantastic."
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Ameer S.,"*take out*
Wow, I was impressed with the Cubano. So many places screw it up, but it was absolutely delicious. Unfortunately, there is a $20 minimum for cards, so if you're ordering take-out, definitely be aware before ordering. The decor inside look nice and homey, and they have BYOB; I'll definitely be back soon to sit inside."
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Kerry H.,"Fantastic little place. Modest decor, very cute. Delicious Cuban style food. Try the empanadas."
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Victoria G.,"Amazing!! I wouldn't change anything about the experience.. The setting was clean/comforting, service was very attentive/not forced, and need I explain the food?? We started with the yuca fries.. then I had the breaded chicken breast which was savory/delicious along with the perfect portion size.. w/black beans and white rice with sweet plantains. My fianc√© had the steak (same sides). To say the least we left with no leftovers.. we'll definitely be back and recommending to others. 
-Forgot to mention the red wine that paired PERFECT with this meal! Yum! (BYOB)"
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Yayo T.,"BYOB's are great. What better excuse for drinking than, ""look honey/ we saved a LOT of money."" Face it you cheap ""BASTAGES,"" that's why you like the BYOB. 

Anyway, this place is a cozy little spot that would be better suited for patio dining. The interior is showing its age, and is in need of a facelift. The food is still solid, seasoned to perfection, and the portions are just right. 

This is more your comfort fit jeans, vs the killer outfit you wear on a Saturday night."
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Ain't It So T.,I have been visiting this restaurant for the past month and each time the food is delicious.   This past Sunday a friend and I decided to have dinner here after enjoying Theatre Week at a local theatre.   The combination platter was fabulous--yucca amazing with garlic sauce.   Our entrees filled the plate and we couldn't stop talking about how we were going to recommend this little gem.  So hope you'll all support this local restaurant that has been around for quite awhile.
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Mike G.,Extraordinary Cuban Food. Best Cubano I've had in many years. I grew up in Miami. Had the maduros and black bean soup as well. All great. Cafe con leche and flan hit the spot. Will come again when in Chicago.
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Brittnay P.,"My partner, girlfriends and I visited Habana Libre last night after visiting the Beauty Bar for Happy Hour.

The wait to be seated was relatively short and throughout our meal our server was very attentive. Overall, the atmosphere of the restaurant was quaint and intimate. 

My partner and I shared the steak jibarito which came with white rice, black beans and plantains. The beans were so delicious and something I'd come back for! The jibarito was fairly good; the steak well-seasoned. The steak could have been more tender."
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Eric M.,My pollo guisado was boiled and flavorless. My friend had chicken jibarito and the breast was still soaking from the boiling. Just sub par and expensive.
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Anna M.,This is a great Cuban spot. I recommend the jibaritos and the veggie tostones. The price is inexpensive and the atmosphere feels authentic. I enjoy the food every time I come and have been half a dozen times. Whenever I crave Cuban this is my go-to spot.
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Stephanie L.,"My parents wanted ""Mexican BYOB"" so they got Cuban BYOB.  

The space was cute inside.  It was a little stuffy when we were there because it was humid outside.  They also have a nice little outdoor patio area.

The service was very mediocre.  Server was forgetful.

The food was kind of meh and pricey for what you got.  We got the appetizer platter for 6...it was like $25 but it really didn't have much on it.  3 empanadas, 3 sticks with ham and cheese, 2 large meat balls, 6 fried plantain circles...kind of ridiculous.  
I had the Cubano.  It was good but I've definitely had better.
Fajitas were ok.  Small and not tons of meat for the price.  $14-17.

Overall it was just ok.  I wouldn't go back."
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Rosa C.,"I have passed this place so many times and never stopped. Since my favorite Cuban sandwich shop closed, I wanted to try another Cuban spot. I was in search for a good Cuban sandwich.

This place hit the spot! Great service, delicious steak sandwich and the Cafe con Leche was perfect.

I would definitely go back!"
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Juliana S.,"Coming from Michigan, where you are hard pressed to find any Cuban food, we were thrilled to find this restaurant when visiting Chicago last weekend. This is a quaint byob. The staff who I'm thinking are family were so sweet and wonderful making us feel like old friends. The food especially the Vaca Frita was awesome. If you want fancy storefront, this isnt for you, but if you want unpretentious, authentic and friendly please give them a try!"
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,R Y.,"I have tried a few Cuban places in the city, ie. 90 Miles both locations, Senor Pan, Cafecito, etc. and this has been our favorite place.
I ordered the chilaquiles at dinner time! Yes, they serve breakfast all day. The skirt steak my daughter ordered was wonderful and perfectly cooked.
The thing I have liked the best is the fried pork chunks. They are tender, juicy, and fatty here. I have had bad experiences at all the other places with dried out meat.
The place isn't the most beautiful thing in the world, but definitely is worth the visit. Also BYOB with a liquor and wine store literally 3 doors down. No corkage fee.
Service is good as well. Ingrid took care of us both times I've been there.
I think I'm going to become a regular."
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Mari H.,"Food was amazing! Great staff, clean, will definitely be back!!!!  And love all the authentic art on the wall. It's truly a little hidden gem!!!"
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Glorimar S.,"The appetizer Tostones Rellenos de ropa vieja were somewhat disappointing. If you're looking for a plate to share (there are 6 mini tostonitos), I suggest ordering but trying a different meat. The ropa vieja just didn't have the correct balance of tomato and plantain. 

HOWEVER, that lech√≥n...oh boy you better make sure you have enough to take home for leftovers."
habana-libre-restaurant-chicago,Gee S.,"Two words: Black Beans!! The beans were delicious. Also had the vegetarian jibarito sandwich. The sandwich lacked seasoning but it was right up my alley since the mock ""bread"" is smashed green plantains. I would give a 4 star but the fact that there was no a.c. on in mid June caused a deduction. The coconut flan is a gift from the gods themselves!!"
bari-chicago,Matthew K.,"Call ahead your order to avoid the line. Head straight down the center aisle to pick up your order and directly pass go. Otherwise, expect to wait during peak hours. Simply go down the left aisle to wait in line to place your order. It's not a horrible wait considering that each sandwich is made to order including grabbing new bread to slice (not D'Amatos for years anymore - don't utter that blasphemous name here.)

I love the old, real Italian store feel from the lined shelves to the no nonsense cashiers. Great products too. My brother loves their giardiniera so much that he brings a jar back home when he visits or I've shipped it to him on occasion.

My go to order is a 12"" Italian sub with hot for $6.75. They always seem to put the freshest produce on the sandwiches. I usually have to eat it immediately cause I have no patience. However, you'll be rewarded if you wait, with the delicious giardiniera oil permeating the whole sandwich after a few hours.

I've also been known to switch up my order. Another favorite is the prosciutto de Parma and fresh mozzarella. I haven't ordered anything on focaccia in years so don't know if it's still offered. If it is, it's a great way to invoke memories of muffalettas without the crusty bread.."
bari-chicago,Jose C.,"So we came here to try their Italian beef. I ordered their 9 inch with hot peppers. I've tread that Bari has one of the best beers in the city. And although it did taste good, definitely not one of the best or even braking top 5. Everything was there. The bread was good, the beef had a good flavor to it, could of used about triple the amount of peppers they put it in. And the same amount for the meat as well. Not enough meat to fill up the sandwich. Bari has to do a lot better than this. 

Now that I've tried their beef, next time I come, I'll stick to their Italian sandwich and meatball sandwich. Those do look very tasty as well."
bari-chicago,Gretchen D.,"So, the subs are decent but we think Graziano's is better. We tried the Italian sub and the Sausage sub.  Good ingredients. The sausage has a bit of bite to it, so do not order if you can't so spicy.  The line and all is a bit chaotic. Definitely do what others have suggested and call the order in first--you'll save a lot of wait time.  Would go with 3.5 stars.

Did not shop, but the grocery items looked fairly authentic.  Better to shop there for Italian groceries that touristy Eataly :)"
bari-chicago,Toni F.,"Bari foods is my go to spot when I have to order lunch for a crowd at work.  Their subs are delicious and they always deliver my order on time and without forgetting anything!  

Their Italian sub and potato salad are my favorite things on the menu.  The meat is fresh, the bread is crusty and you can order them in 3 ft. sizes or in platters with an assortment of three varieties.  I love that they have online ordering too."
bari-chicago,Phil D.,"I can't say anything else more that hasn't already been said, except that when it comes to fresh Italian subs, this place delivers. Great sub, fresh meats, and hella cheap at less than $6 for a 9"" or less than $7.50 for a 12"", either of which probably serve as two meals. They are fast, courteous, and old-school, so you can look around and grab some other stuff from the market in the 3 minutes it takes to make your sandwich. The one thing that slightly detracts is that the bread they use I think could be a bit softer, but for the price, I'll gladly head next door to d'amato's for their bread, and just transplant everything over. I suppose one day I'll try their other sandwiches too, since the meatball, focaccia, and prosciutto + fresh mozzarella look good too, but for now I'm happy eating my spicy Italian for days. 4.5/5"
bari-chicago,Jen C.,"Not really understanding the 5 stars given everywhere on this place- ordered 7 sandwiches for my team- called in for pick up- the person on the phone was very friendly and efficient. 

I got the Italian sandwich for myself- I can't like a place if the bread is not fresh when you're a sandwich shop. I'm reading other reviews and people are commenting on their flaky and soft french bread- but what I got was so hard and crunchy that it was hard to bite into it- I'm wondering if my bread was over baked or if it was too old. If mine was just a fluke then I hope this establishment works on their consistency and make all of their sandwiches with fresh baked bread. The oil and seasoning on the sandwich was overwhelming- and the filling of the meat was minimal- 

I'll stick to Hero's sandwiches on western and addison- never disappoints!"
bari-chicago,Joani O.,"As much as my family and I love Bari, I was embarrassed to recommend them for a staff lunch for my department at work today. One of my managers called and placed the order, which was sandwiches for 18 people. He had mentioned that the woman who took the order was rushing and he had to repeat the credit card information several times. 

We requested delivery by 11:30, and by 12:45 we still had not received our order. He called Bari back, and was told that the delivery driver had been here and left, because he didn't have the correct phone number. The woman on the phone told him that HE had given her the wrong number. (Why would we do that? You're saying that someone who has worked here for 30 years doesn't know his own phone number?) AND the delivery driver was looking for ""312"" and our address is 321...there is no 312. He was here, in front of our building after realizing that there was no 312, yet instead of asking at the front desk for our company and my staff person's name, he left! He left with our order instead of trying to contact anyone! After waiting for so long we called again and gave the phone number and correct address again, and he finally came back. Wow.

Perhaps the worst of all was that we asked them if they would label each sandwich with each person's name, so we would know whose sandwich was whose. (We order lunches once a month and every other establishment does this for us.) Yet the Bari lady said NO, that they would label them by number, and when passing out the food, we could go in the order that we placed the order. Well guess what. They must not have made the sandwiches in this same order, because they were definitely not in order! Several people didn't get what they ordered and it was sheer chaos. My tuna was good as usual, yet I didn't receive the cheese that I requested, and we didn't get any gardinera, which we had ordered on the side. A number of other things were wrong, so we called again, spoke to someone different (a male this time), and they were coming back with the corrections. 

This was TRULY a disaster, and again, I am embarrassed that I recommended Bari! My husband said I should call myself, since we love Bari, but the damage was done. After all the sorting, the people who go to lunch at 11:30 didn't get their food until almost 1:30!...way past after their lunch was over. At this point everyone couldn't take a late lunch all at the same time, so I doubt if we will order delivery from here again, sadly!"
bari-chicago,Heather S.,"I ordered a group lunch from Bari and everyone loved it. The chicken soup was great. The tuna, caprese, and Italian subs were all delicious. Very much recommend!"
bari-chicago,Jeff C.,"Great sausage.  Great sandwiches.  Nice Italian grocery.  What's not to like?  Parking is tough. The bread next door at D'Amato's is slightly better than what they have at Bari.  You could go to Bari, buy all the fixings for your sammie, then go to D'Amato's and buy the bread and it would be the perfect sandwich"
bari-chicago,Rosemary D.,"The greatest place to eat, sandwiches and all sorts of cheeses, salami, etc. Love their olive onion mozzarella salad. Everything is fresh, also store carries so many items on shelves and and freezers that you cannot find elsewhere. 
Always packed with as many people. 
Go 4 times a week. Awesome place, you have to try."
bari-chicago,Rick M.,"I'm an Italian man from a small town in CT with a lot of other Italians in it. If you're looking up Bari, you probably know what I'm talking about (yes, I pronounce Ricotta ""Reegawt"" and I make a mean sausage and peppers...). When I was growing up, one thing we were never short on was those little family owned Italian delis. Seriously, one on every corner! Either that or a pizza place... although most were a mix of the two.

I've lived in both NYC and Chicago for years and I just could never find a place with that same feel I experienced in my childhood years. For those of you die-hard sub fans, I would visit the South Loop years ago and Panazzo's was the only place that ever came close... real close! I was devastated when they closed down! 

For so long I've been searching for that perfect old-style Italian deli. I've had a craving for Cherry Peppers stuffed with prosciutto and cheese that I just couldn't shake.

So after a bit of research, today I decided to take an adventure to a short block off the Grand Blue Line that's home to Bari and D'Amato's bakery, true friendly rivals for decades. (I've reviewed D'Amato's too!) 

I'm sure you know Italians are some of the most honest folks out there... so I'm going to give it to you straight: 

Bari, your stuffed cherry peppers are perfection. They are truly a work of art and I will frequent your deli many times over and literally buy them by the pound. I'm so happy I found you for them and can't wait to try your many other homemade or imported delicacies. Sincerely thank you for being one of the only places in Chicago to make and carry these. 

Now to the real kicker. I also ordered a turkey sandwich... which, I'm so sorry to say...was far from enjoyable. If I was rating you guys on the sandwich alone, you'd get 1 star. I had really high hopes and really didn't have extra high expectations, just realistic ones. 

Bari totally has that family-owned Italian deli feel and smell (because it's legit), but apparently the quality just isn't there. I was SO disappointed in that sub. I write this not to diss you, but to sincerely let you know how to improve. So you know, the inside ingredients were actually good (except for the packaged American cheese that I asked the guy to change)... but what the hell happened to the bread!?!? 

What's a matta witchyu!?! 

Everyone knows a good sub (or grinder as we call it out East) is only 30% the ingredients and 70% the bread! Folks, your bread was completely old and stale, hard and chewy. It made the sandwich not enjoyable in the least. FYI - this sentiment is echoed by some other Yelpers, too, just so you all know I'm not crazy. Because of this, I also don't think this was some kind of one time fluke. 

I probably will only return for your peppers and other goods. But, who knows, I might give you all another shot later down the road. Really though, if only the bread was soft, I'd be returning on a weekly basis. 

Anyway, I was slightly prepared for this to be the case, so I picked up another sub next door to do a taste test comparison. I know that's nuts, but I really needed to do this. Well, the results are in and  D'Amato's is by far the winner. Their bread is far superior and the sandwich was everything I had been looking for. 

(Yelpers, please see my review of D'Amato's for reference)"
bari-chicago,Anuj S.,"I've order Bari for delivery a couple of times. I'm surprised I never reviewed it. The best part about Bari's sandwiches is the bread. I guess you gotta nail the bread if you're going to be a great sandwich place. The bread is great. The one previous time we ordered, I got extra eggplant, extra cheese and the super hot peppers. OK, all of that was way way overload. Way too much cheese, way too much eggplant and the hot peppers were SO hot, we couldn't really eat the sandwiches. Beware of the super hot!! :) 

So last time I toned it all down - not extra anything. I got the regular hot giardinera. It was still pretty darn spicy. I mean, and I can put down some spice. Maybe it's in the eggplant, I don't know. I doubt it, because the eggplant is probably the part that is ruining this sandwich for me. It's kind of like uncooked, slices of eggplant, and it was still too much. I took some of the slices out.

The delivery and prices were great. Things came on time and all that. I just wish they had some other vegetarian options other than the eggplant option."
bari-chicago,Scott K.,"Hooo-wee! That's some good eats!

Trip to Chicago meant I had to get all the wonderful things I can't get on the west coast, namely deep dish pizza, giardineira and hot Italian beef sandwiches. I accomplished two of the three here! So glad for the handy yelp app, otherwise never would have found a place like this. 

Ordered a hot beef sandwich, add provolone and hot giardineira. MAAAAN. That's what I'm talking about. So simple yet so good. Bought three jars to take home. Yes it meant I had to check luggage on the plane... but totally worth it!"
bari-chicago,Emily H.,"Small grocery store with a deli counter at the back. The sandwiches here are made to order and all quite cheap considering the amount of the protein they give you. They have 3 sizes: 9 inches, 12 inches, and 3-footer, it's amazing to see those 3-footer sandwiches, it could seriously feed a family for one meal. We got a 9-inch sausage sandwich and a 12-inch meatball for the two of us for Sunday lunch, and we quite stuffed that we didn't even eat dinner, and we are not light eaters on diet either, that's how big their portion is. The sausage and meatball are both marked with family recipe, it is a bit spicy and quite tasty.

You can buy raw sausage and salami to take home, we got some of the white sausage, it is very good, a bit salty, but very tasty (I guess due to the fat they put in the sausage too)."
bari-chicago,Jake C.,"Best subs and cheap

Old school

The turkey one and the eggplant parm are good for warm or cold weather 

Good giardienera too"
bari-chicago,Tim O.,"My office had this place catered and it was one of the worst catered lunches we've ever had. The bread was old and the sandwiches basic. I understand the draw of the old-world Italian grocer, but this place has no business catering. In line with some of the other negative reviewers, I can't help but wonder whether the stellar reviews have been left by those romanticizing days long past."
bari-chicago,Denise M.,Great sub!  I had the veggie Italian 9 inch.  It's a nice size sandwich and made for 2 meals for me. Pic included is of 1/2 the sandwich.
bari-chicago,John B.,"Foods good but the service is terrible!!!

I stopped going  because it just wasn't worth the headache. 

There could be 2 people in line and the help would  just look at you and continue to do their own thing.

Good food but I say FUGEDABODIT !!!!!"
bari-chicago,J. P.,Excellent subs.  We got an Italian and an American.  Both enjoyed thoroughly.
bari-chicago,Scott M.,"I've been going here for over 30 years. They have the best sub sandwiches. This is a place just for take-out , but worth the trip. It's an Italian grocery store so you can get some shopping done if needed. Call ahead if you know what you want because the wait can get long at lunch time. Parking can sometimes be a little tough."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,P M.,"The perfect local diner! They treat us like neighbors. Have seen our two boys grow. Great for families (although the new alcohol license is only for adults!). Too many fav meals to share all---breakfast burrito, south of the border skillet, any eggs Benedict (homemade hollandaise sauce is perfection), pulled pork sandwich, buffalo chicken wrap, blueberry muffin, health club--to name a few. Looking forward to a future visit!"
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Deborah C.,"Brunch on a Sunday:

$5 house cocktails! Delicious and large drinks. Will only serve alcohol starting 10 AM, which I learned is a city wide thing. 

Delicious chicken sandwich with waffle fries.

Fries could have bene crispier, server could have asked us if we wanted to order anything else before bringing our check, twice. But all in all, a great place to eat :)"
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Melissa J.,"Love this local gem. 

My go-to on the menu is the South of the Border Skillet. I am a sucker for chorizo! It is usually entirely too much food so I take half to go. 

They now serve alcohol! Our first time trying a boozy breakfast, I ordered a beermosa and my husband ordered a bloody mary. Mine was delicious and he said his was a little spicy. 

It gets pretty crowded in the mornings on the weekends so be prepared to wait! Very kid friendly. We have a one year old and always feel comfortable here. 

I have noticed that they seem to have raised prices recently. It can add up quickly! On our last trip, we ordered two alcoholic drinks and two adult breakfasts-- with tip is was $65! We used to go more often but it may turn into a once a month kind of place!"
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Shelli M.,"Neat little gem with some yummy treats!
We arrived Sunday morning for some recovery breakfast!  About a 15-20 minute wait for Party of 5. No worries, they gave us some coffee while we waited. We did have to wait standing outside but the weather was perfect and sun was shining so we didn't mind at all.
The parking situation is a little sticky and the actual intersection is confusing for us Suburbanites. 
We were seated and served quickly. Everyone loved their orders and had plenty leftover!
We would definitely return and recommend to others."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Alex S.,"Looking for a greasy spoon cafe for a solid breakfast, look no farther.

I love this spot, it's right near my house and right near the blue line spot. The service is quick and quality, there's a long menu of delicious breakfast item and everything is well made and cheap.

I got the biscuits and gravy, eggs and potatoes. Everything was really good, a solid, decent breakfast for sure. 

I am a little sad that they changed the shredded potatoes to diced potatoes. I know it's a small thing but shredded potatoes are the best and diced potatoes are sadly not. 

But I liked grabbing a quick, easy, decent breakfast here and will be back to do it again."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Carolina N.,"It's a cute spot for sure in a great location but the food left much to be desired, and it's too expensive!! I'd only return for the convenience factor, and the friendly service."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Stephanie L.,"Whoa?!?!!  What happened?!?!!

This is probably my most frequented restaurant in the city.  I have about 25 check ins...and that's not including the times I was just too hungover to deal with Yelp.  I used to LOVE, I mean love their omelettes and the overall vibe.  I was so excited for them to get their liquor license and now I feel like a deflated balloon after a shitty New Year's Eve party.  

Been here twice since the change.  
1.  The menu has changed...more trendy and upscale.  Of course, more expensive, which I can totally understand.  It just kind of lost its luster for me.  I feel like it's a teenage girl playing dress up...and failing miserably.  
2.  ""Housemade"" Bloody Mary...I was salivating as I ordered it and when I received it, I wanted to throw a tantrum like a 2 year old...it wasn't good.  All of my hopes and dreams that this could be my all around breakfast place quickly faded away as I barely could sip the less than average BM.  So sad.  Sniffle.  I even left half of it on the table.
3.  Where's all the old staff??  There's only like half the people that used to work here...all of the fantastic servers and hosts, etc...????  Where'd you go????
4.  Can you say...ssslllllllllooooooooooww.  Both times it was AWFUL.  We were sat immediately but the drink order took a good 10 mins.  I could understand if it was all booze but the second time we only had an OJ and a coffee.  The first time I was the only one that ordered anything to drink.  We even beat the morning rush and arrived before 9a.  The food seemed to take forever and the overall vibe has changed.  I just cannot put my finger on it.
5.  At 9a with less than half of the restaurant filled on a Sunday, they were blasting metal music.  We are sitting right under the speaker and mid way through breakfast, asked if they could turn it down a notch.  Server said yes, but I'm pretty sure she forgot because I struggled to hear my mom who was sitting right across from me for the rest of the meal.

Ugh, I am dumbfounded by what in the heck happened during the change over!  
Even my Malibu omelette didn't seem to taste the same as the old fluffy, heavenly omelettes they used to serve.  Alas, WCC seems just like any old bfast place now.  I guess I'm back on the hunt for somewhere to love."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Julie S.,"Windy City Cafe is a casual neighborhood diner that serves great brunch/lunch. The place is pretty big, but you might have to wait a few minutes for a table on the weekends. There are lots of sweet and savory options on the menu. The service is quick, and the portions are big. There's nothing super special about the place overall, but it's a good choice if you're in the area and your stomach is grumbling."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Helen C.,"The food and service is amazing!! I had eggs, bacon and pancakes.  I recommend all of them.  The coffee isn't bad either."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Wayne H.,"A good place for breakfast with all the standards and then some.   It has a small parking lot in the back, plenty of seating even for the sunday rush, and you can grab a peppermint patty on the way out."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Nikita S.,"Went here on a whim based on yelp reviews and was NOT disappointed. Got there around 11:30 on a Sunday and had to wait about 10 minutes (not bad) for a table. 

I had the breakfast burrito with potatoes. Uh maze ing. I recommend getting it with sausage and do the sour cream on the side but salsa inside. I could only eat about half of it before I was full. Coffee was hot and water plentiful. 

UPDATE: Owner messaged me to let me know there is a parking lot behind the restaurant. Good to know!

I'm ready to go back and try lunch!"
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Jenn H.,"What a wonderful surprise to stumble upon this neighborhood gem! It was a chilly December day, and we didn't want to go too far, so we decided to check out this diner that we'd walked by a number of times. So glad we did!

It's a no frills diner, so don't expect to be wowed by the decor. However the food is quite good. We both ended up ordering the South of the Border Skillet and splitting a side of the biscuits and gravy. While it's definitely a spicy dish, it was soooo tasty. The biscuits and gravy were also amazing. I am a huge biscuits and gravy person, and these did not disappoint. Oh, and the portions are big, so prepare to be stuffed to the brim or take home leftovers.

The service was great, too! Our waitress was very attentive and provided stellar recommendations. I love that they leave a water carafe on the table as well, which came in quite handy while eating the oh so spicy skillet!

The only somewhat downside is that they do not serve alcohol, so you'll have to get your Bloody Mary elsewhere. But quality breakfast served all day is a win in my book."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Etny C.,"Nice homey, laid back place kinda like a Ihop. Large portions and friendly service. Food nothing out of the ordinary/special."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Jennifer R.,Get the waffle fries-delicious. Great coffee but they could get cream that doesn't come in those little individual creamers
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Jessica M.,"I recently moved to River West with my boyfriend and we took a walk to find brunch in the neighborhood on our first weekend there.  We stumbled upon a humble looking diner - Windy City Cafe, and were very pleasantly surprised.  We arrived at 11am and there was a 25 minute wait (once we were seated it seemed to clear out so you might not always have to wait depending on when the rush comes that day), but we expected a wait anywhere on a Sunday morning.  Definitely go across the street to Big Shoulders Coffee to get a drink and a doughnut while you wait.  My omelet was fluffy and fresh and my boyfriend's skillet meal was delicious.  The service was quick and friendly and I would definitely go back.  Overall this was an elevated diner experience and I would recommend it to anyone!"
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Jennifer N.,"Don't be fooled by the atmosphere which looks NJ diner circa 1985.  (Or else interpret it ironically).  This is the place. It's the spot for a breakfast so hearty you won't need to eat again until dinner, or a stomach-filling lunch (and I love that they serve breakfast AND lunch all day).  The eggceptional (haha!) skillets are a work of art - perfectly scrambled eggs with a savory crispy mash of veggies, and a fat slab of sourdough bread.

Tip: This spot pairs well with a trip to Intuit."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Chris S.,"What a great spot! Great food, prompt and friendly service! So glad we popped in for breakfast on our trip to the Windy City."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Brian G.,"Just adding an update to the review. They are rebranding and it is now Windy CIty Cafe instead of Windy City Diner. Presumably they are trying to make it more upscale. There is a new menu which is expansive but two of the things we used to order are not on it (Roasted Red Pepper Benedict and Salmon Benedict.

I wound up having a south of the border skillet, I didn't want the chorizo but they substituted green and red peppers. It was very good.

As usual the service and food was still very good. I've been there 7 or 8 times and only once was the service subpar and they rectified it.

Still recommend it, I just hope they turn into something pretentious.  Very good place.

------------------------------------------------------------

Wonderful breakfast place. Kind of a hipster vibe if that is your thing. Food very well cooked. I had a salmon benedict and it was great, the potatoes were delicious as well."
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Tara P.,Good local spot for breakfast with a pretty decent menu selection. Consistent quality for the past 4 years. Friendly prompt service.
windy-city-cafe-chicago,Lena A.,"My friend and I were visiting Chicago for the first time and we were lucky to stay around that area so we can discover this hidden gem!!! We loved it so much that we went twice during our 4 days vacation!! First time we ordered the Farmer's omelette and banana bread french toast which both were super delicious! The second time we changed the french toast to buttermilk pancakes and it was just perfect!  
Besides the great food and ambiance the service was beyond great! Valerie was our waitress and she was the best, she even remembered what we ordered the first time and she was happy to see us. She even had our order split to two plates since we are sharing without even asking!! That just added a great homy feeling that you can't easily find in such a touristy big city!! I'll definitely come back whenever I visit Chicago again."
uncle-julios-chicago,Alice A.,"Had a great meal here on a Monday night. The place was lively yet not too crowded, the service was fast and friendly, and the food was delicious. There was a good mix of families with kids, friends hanging out, and couples dining.

The chips and salsa at the beginning of the meal were a great start. We ordered the queso with ground beef, honey chipotle chicken fajitas with flour tortillas, the carne asada, and the mini cojeta for dessert. We honestly enjoyed everything we ordered.

The only downside is the parking lot is $10 for dinner, so we ended up parking for free on a side street a block away."
uncle-julios-chicago,Dustin G.,"This review has nothing to do with the food, which by the way is pretty good.  Felt compelled to share a remarkable service story.

We rolled into the UJ parking lot with a flat tire.  Actually it was worse than that, the tire was almost coming off the rim.  All of a sudden, a small army of UJ and valet employees, led by the General Manager himself, crowded around to help.  Right in front of their main entrance, the GM himself changed our tire and put on the spare.  

We go to the restaurant a lot for good margaritas and predictable Mexican comfort food.  Never expected a tire change.  Five stars and two thumbs up for caring about your customers!"
uncle-julios-chicago,Gabi R.,"The food was mediocre. The parking here was hard to find, however they did have valet. The waitress that served our food was nice and attentive, but the hostess did a dreadful job. Once we entered the restaurant the hostess didn't greet us, but stared at us. I had to take the initiative to say ""party of 3"". She then handed us menus at the entrance, before she sat us down. Strange. I thought that if we were being seated at a table you normally have us take a seat first and then place the menus on the table and/or hand them to us. Is that a Chicago thing? I've never experienced that before, even when I sat at a bar or dinning by a bar. 

Stuck to a simple appetizer, but the quesadillas were not all that. I enjoyed it for what it was, wanted a quick bite and drinks. Place was a bit overpriced if you asked me, drinks especially. The inside was very decorative; I must say it was very festive, a lot of people in and out. I can see why it would be popular, its huge, but my family members raved about this place and I just didn't see what all the hype was about. I've had better experiences elsewhere, however for someone traveling and visiting a new place, I had higher expectations. I did enjoy my beverage, you can check it out on my uploaded pictures. I'd recommend the Platinum Swirl drink, but other than that I wouldn't waste my time."
uncle-julios-chicago,Mehran F.,"I normally avoid chain restaurants, but after driving by Uncle Julio so often and thinking of my Dallas days, had to try it. I used to go there in Dallas when (to my knowledge) they were not a chain.

Still nice. Not great but certainly fine.

Fajitas cost twice as much and portions are half as much as 20 some years ago but were delicious and done medium rare as I had asked.

Service. Average chain quality.

Probably more of a 3.5/5 but I'd rather err on the generous side. I doubt I'd go back but am happy i went there."
uncle-julios-chicago,Sabrina C.,"*blank stare* 

Once upon a time I remember when coming here was a guaranteed treat. Food and service was great. The atmosphere was lovely. 

That's kind of changed.

For one, maybe I just didn't remember correctly but had no idea that you had to pay $10 to park in the lot VALET OR NOT. Sign says ten bucks is for valet..... but the lot attendant came and knocked on our window after we had parked ourselves and told us it was ten bucks or we had to go. Well alrighty.

The food. *sigh* Besides it being overpriced, it now tastes like your average Mexican fare. I've had some taco trucks on random streets on the westside that are better. I got the flauta dinner and my friend got the fish tacos. Apparently the fish tacos are the saving grace because mine was yawn worthy. The margarita I had definitely tastes like a premade mix. A premade mix that was 11 bucks a glass. 

Our waiter was........... let's just say it was kind of obvious that he didn't really feel like being at work. Interactions with him was very cut and dry. 

The best thing about the dinner was the free chips and salsa. Seriously.

Yeah. Probably won't be coming here again. Unless I'm drunk. Wait, no. There's always McDonald's. 

K bye."
uncle-julios-chicago,Rhona K.,"Yes, I have experienced better. Coming here is like going to the apple store. Everything costs extra money, it's super crowded, and you're not sure if you're getting what you pay for (ahem, iPhone X).

$10 or more (with tips) for Valet whether you like it or not (we chose to find street parking further away thank goodness), and it is PACKED in here...granted we came at 5PM on a Saturday night, but driving/walking by this location you'll notice it is generally pretty busy here. 

Only seating we had was at the bar, and when I got the menu, I pretty much just gawked at the prices. For a chain Mexican restaurant, don't be expecting authentic food or large quantities....here it is $$ for everything. A spoonful of guac is around $7, their famous margaritas are $13 a glass, entrees all ranging from $13 - $30 or so. Chips and salsa was free, but their salsa was pretty average to poor in my opinion, being just a peppered non spicy mixture, and their chips were extremely oily and not salted. 

The entree I got took about 35 minutes to prepare, and it was just 3 shrimp tacos with rice and beans. Each taco had 3 small shrimp in it, and although the pineapple and fruit filling was interesting, it wasn't exactly a savory match (also, their corn tortillas were cold and just didn't fit the flavor profile of the taco's contents). Rice and beans were okay, but nothing amazing.

Saving grace was the bartender, who split our raspberry margarita in half so me and my partner could both have a glass :) Overall yes, I've experienced better (ESPECIALLY when it comes to Mexican food...), but the whole place would've been better if they maybe made their prices lower, served more guac, and changed their whole parking system. You could easily spend $50 just by yourself here (parking+drink+food+guac+tips).

Oh, and also, despite being overpriced, their guac is HELLA good. props to that."
uncle-julios-chicago,Dan P.,"I do not know how this place has less than 4 stars. Every time I have been here, since I first moved to the city over 10 years ago, everything has been excellent. Their margaritas are fresh and spicy/flavorful, their chicken fajitas are almost perfect, they recently added table-side guac which is also tasty and of course made to order. I've never had anything less than a 5-star experience."
uncle-julios-chicago,Steve A.,"Uncle Julio's serves pretty good TexMex for a chain restaurant. The place is large and can get quite noisy, but the front rooms and the side patio are quieter. 

I really liked my Patron skinny margarita. It was indistinguishable from a regular margarita with only 120 calories. Deal!

I had the Benito's combo. The chicken enchilada and pork tamale were excellent, but the chile relleno had absolutely no flavor in the breading, the chile itself or the cheese filling. The beans and rice were good. 

Service was prompt and friendly."
uncle-julios-chicago,Christina S.,"I ordered through Doordash enough for lunch and dinner.  Food was carefully packed and appears just as it does in the restaurant.

Nachos with refried bean spread and a substantial layer of melted cheese....mmmmmmmmm delicious...not piled up-but just a series of individual round tortilla chips with refried bean spread and cheese melted on the top. Toppings included guacamole, shredded lettuce, and sour cream....soooo good! (I added my own salsa from my fridge in picture)

Cup of Tortilla Soup....average..with bits of corn, one slicer of avocado and shredded tortilla chips on top added a nice texture to each bite. (I added sour cream in picture)

Honey Chipotle Fajitas...good portion included sides (Mexican style rice and beans) and four small flour tortillas in a lined foil bag to keep them warm and to prevent them from drying out.

Bag of house made tortilla chips with ""Uncle Julio"" flashing a big smile on the front were included!  Delicious...but WHERE was the SALSA????

Hmmmmmmm inquiring minds want to know?

Good go-to ""comfort food!"""
uncle-julios-chicago,Mysel O.,"My shrimp tacos were cold but I was really there for the drinks anyways! 
I thought Adil and Marie were my favorite bartenders but Teddy steam rolls right over them!!!!!! She was so welcoming! She's my new favorite bartender!"
uncle-julios-chicago,Cinthya Q.,"Good, flavorful food, delicious (strong) drinks, nice small patio, and delicious deserts.  We tried the ribs and they were surprisingly delicious.  Who thinks of ribs when they think Uncle Julio's?  They were tender and feel off the bone. 

We also had the steak fajitas; they were juicy and perfectly done (I ordered medium).  The onion/peppers with the steak were also very delicious and tasty.  

For dessert we had the flan and it was decadent and very rich. 

The drinks were strong but all very delicious.  My favorite is their half margarita half sangria.  It's so good."
uncle-julios-chicago,Jasmine S.,Meh! What can I say about uncle Julio's? Only thing good are the chips. Salsa is weird tasting. The guacamole that they make taste like the avocados aren't organic which I hate. Margarita is overly sugared that it gives me a headache.
uncle-julios-chicago,Michelle P.,"We visited on Thursday lunch time. There were a few other patrons inside and much more in their patio seating outside. We order steak and chicken fajitas (lunch size) and a steak and enchilada dinner. Both entrees were delicious with perfectly cooked medium steak. 

Complimentary chips and salsa always amazing and bottomless Coke products. Also our server was great. 

Only downfall is if you want to park in their parking lot, you HAVE TO valet. Valet is $7 for lunch and $10 for dinner. 

High chairs available for kids. Moist wipes available to for dirty hands."
uncle-julios-chicago,Sarah S.,"I went to Uncle Julio's thinking it was more of a drink spot but it's actually a sit down Tex-Mex dinner type of place. Noted! They actually had a good number of margaritas and festive drinks but only 3 craft beers, none on tap. Wah Wahhhh.

I ended up ordering the 3 Soft Chicken Taco plate which came white people style with lettuce and tomatoes on them. They had a good portion of all ingredients and everything was nice & fresh! The plate also came with Mexican rice and frijoles a la charra. Really big meal for $13.49.

We had good service throughout, as well. We weren't rushed but our orders both for drinks & food came out quite quickly. Honestly, our server seemed to be there at just the right time every time we needed a drink refill. Pretty much service perfection without being invasive.

I have drive past Uncle Julio's a million times and always wondered what it was like inside. Now I know! And it's pretty darn cool!"
uncle-julios-chicago,Michael S.,"Love this place! They have excellent food with large portions and make the tortillas fresh onsite. There is a tortilla maker by the kitchen and you can watch them being made. Its very neat and worth checking out! 

The weather was beautiful when I went to have dinner there. I wanted to have tableside guacamole and asked the host if you sit outdoors, will they come by with tableside guac. She said yes but was disappointed when I found out, they do not do that unless you are indoors. They will bring out the guacamole but you don't get the full experience. 

Aside from that, I'd definitely be coming back amd reccomend the guacamole and the shredded chicken tacos."
uncle-julios-chicago,Irena B.,"One of our favorite spots in the city to go as a family, even my picky eater loves the food! Tonight we went to celebrate my husband's birthday. It was our best experience yet! Matt our server was amazing, attentive and quick! The food (steak fajitas, table-side guacamole, chicken tenders) was delicious but the best part was the chocolate pi√±ata dessert!"
uncle-julios-chicago,Ally M.,"Uncle Julio's is great for big groups, and have a great variation of Mexican food items to meet everyone in your party's taste bud needs! Without a doubt the best part about UJ's is the Chocolate Pi√±ata!! Pro tip: hit the baton on the TOP of the chocolate pi√±ata for better chocolate breakage--not the side!"
uncle-julios-chicago,Meg B.,"While the food is delicious, it still seems to be a bit overpriced.  I sat alone at the bar for lunch and ordered a cocktail, an appetizer and an entree for a little over $50.  The bartender was attentive and gave great service, but overall I don't think the experience was worth the amount of money I paid.  However, honey glazed salmon makes some good leftovers!"
uncle-julios-chicago,Peter H.,"If you're  in your car, you're going to pay $10 right off the bat just to park. That's ok in downtown Chicago but right away the bar is set a little higher. We had a very nice meal. Good queso, decent enchiladas both chicken and beef, a very good relleno, and tamale, excellent beans and a tasty, if simple, taco. And the service was excellent. The server was quick, friendly and even showed up with a glass of soda water and a napkin when he noticed my wife spill a little on her top. So if you're looking for some
good, straight up Tex Mex or Colorado/New Mexico/Utah Mexican food, this is the place. Unless your are price sensitive. Because this place is not cheap. Including parking, maybe triple what you'd pay for a similar meal elsewhere. I liked it though."
uncle-julios-chicago,Marcello S.,"Everyone talked about how great this restaurant was  - I had dinner at this place twice and the restaurant is VERY LOUD, and everything about it said hurry up; order, eat, pay the bill and leave. The parking is terrible and the charge for the valet to park your car is $10.   

Tonight asked the waiter to make a slight change to the order and he agreed - when it arrived at the table it was wrong and we could not get out waiter for 10 minutes.

I will never go to this restaurant again!"
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Coleen K.,"What a great neighborhood bar! It took us awhile to try this place, but boy am I glad we did. 

Aberdeen Tap has the feel of a bar that's been there for ages. It's consistently filled with regulars, and the bartenders seem to truly enjoy what they do. I love that the bar opens up so easily to the outside -- they've got two full sidewalks of outdoor tables and the bar itself opens up all the windows and doors in good weather.

Most importantly, Aberdeen Tap serves fresh and creative bar food. I love that the feature specials for various nights of the week. As everyone else mentions, their sweet potato tots are AMAZING. I like that they have an inexpensive bottle of house wine each night, and the fiance always enjoys their beer selection.

If you're looking for somewhere simple, comfortable and great in River West, look no further!"
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Blair M.,"We sought refuge while walking around the chilly city, and found this cozy spot. It wasn't very busy, as it was early in the day, which was perfect. The street outside was blocked off for a movie filming, which is not uncommon in Chicago. On a normal day, parking would have been right outside, which was fine!

It was blistering cold outside, and we were welcomed by warm and friendly bartenders. We ordered a simple chicken sandwich and fries, with a double Jameson neat on the side, but it was more than a bite and a drink that kept us. Good convo, nice tv views from the bar, and a cool environment were bonuses.

Highly recommend if you are in the area!"
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Rhonda F.,"Stopped in this cute neighborhood gem for a quick dinner on a Monday night. So many places are closed on Mondays but luckily they were open. 

Brick walls, big windows and a long bar frame the small room. The windows are actually garage doors that roll completely open when the weather allows. The rustic, casual vibe was perfect. 

There was live entertainment, which was a bit loud but very good. What a fun surprise!

We ordered margaritas, shrimp tacos and the Cubano sandwich. Everything was delicious and fresh. My friend and I shared and we both loved everything. 

Our server was friendly and professional. She made a great experience exceptional. As we were leaving the bartender called out a friendly farewell. Nice touch!

Parking is free and easy to find. So many reasons to try Aberdeen Tap!!"
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Joe H.,"Sweet neighborhood spot to grab a drink and food. The weekly burger deal on Wednesday is hard to beat. The fries are also great. Usually ya e a rotating draft that's fairly priced, but a cheap one is always an option here."
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,DAVID C.,"I went here for dinner and drinks, my total bill was $20.81. This was on May 25, 2017. I gave a generous more than 20% of the bill tip of $5.00 even though the waitress was slow and rude. I put in the tip amount of $5.00 and wrote on both the merchant and customer copy the total of $25.00 Surprise when i got my credit card bill i guess the $5.00 wasn't enough as the waitress added another $2.00. I didn't complain because it was only $2.00 but i if this place does it to 10 people it's another $20.00 in their pocket. I would not go back to this place again. I didn't think this could be possible but apparently it happens more than you think. I had another take out place do it to me Harold's Chicken. So pay with cash when you go out to eat then that can't do this. Be forewarned."
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Joe S.,"I had lunch @ Aberdeen this Sunday after having dinner in Fulton Market 5 days earlier.  The distance between these locations is 6 blocks.  The price difference was 100% more on Fulton , the food was about equal..both are great.  The hip factor is better @ Aberdeen if you are a Chicagoan.  We had excellent/unique nachos- pulled pork style, excellent beer and cider, and excellent sweet potato snacks.  Great bar , great prices, cool people"
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Mihir S.,"After seeing so many stars, my buddy and I came here after eating dinner nearby. Average service, average drinks, and an average bar atmosphere.

What did I miss?"
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Liz B.,"One of our favorite bars in the neighborhood with an outside patio. We went for Sunday brunch, surprisingly it was open on Easter. 

I am a sucker for a deal/special/discount and this spot has great daily specials. Weekends they offer $5 bloodies & mimosas, we had at least 3 Bloody Maria (tequila, my fav). You can't go wrong with any of the burgers or the pulled pork nachos. I recommend substituting the steak fries for sweet potato fries. 

**Wednesday's they offer $5 burgers**

Enjoy!"
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Caroline B.,"Total neighborhood gem. Friendly bartenders, great beer selection and tasty bar food. Huge fan of the mac and cheese bites and the fish tacos. They play the best music and show all the good games on tv. An all time favorite bar."
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Natalia F.,"Really good pub food, perfect beer selection and amazingly friendly staff. Great neighborhood pub for sure"
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Nikki C.,"This is another 5 star review.

Once again, please do not weigh my opinion on any type of scale.

You have been warned not to read this.

They have underberg and a miller high life for $7 US. 

Sometimes the tender behind the bar will join you in a toast. 

I surprisingly was not sitting alone here.

I was surrounded by fully visually sighted and educated people that live fulfilling adventurous lives.

I did not have to pay them to let me sit close by. 

I think they actually liked me.

I was happy.

For once.

and not alone.

Awesome bar.

good times.

there are 2 single use squatters labeled for the 2 conventional genders towards the back.
Clean and with running water to wash your hands properly."
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Colin S.,"We held an after party here for a larger group (25+ people). The staff did an awesome job with service for our entire group and it was great to have the back room all to ourselves. I would highly recommend this as an event space, in addition to being a great neighborhood bar!"
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Ashley A.,"Love this place. Good drinks, great music and great food! The sweet potato tots, chiliyaki and jerk wings are my fav!"
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Eric B.,"I try to go here each and every time we dog sit for our uncles. 

Wednesday's, they have $5 burgers. 

The beer is great, the food is great. 

Try it once, it will become your favorite bar in west loop."
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Amber C.,"There's PBR on tap; what more do you need?

We stumbled upon this hidden gem thanks to Yelp. What a phenomenal discovery! I knew from the moment that we walked in the door that we had found the perfect place for a weekday night.

The Aberdeen Tap is a perfectly sized space that can accommodate five or fifty of your closest friends. The building itself is nondescript from the outside, but absolutely beautiful on the inside with exposed brick, granite coutettops, and retractable garage doors which look like they'd  be perfect on a warm summer evening. 

Our bartenders Chris and Zak (named after the movie) were truly phenomenal. They made us feel like Norm must have felt every time he walked in to Cheers. Chris has been here since opening day (5 years!) and you can tell that he's truly passionate about his work. What a stellar example of customer service! 

The food is DELISH. Definitely try the fried mac and cheese and the gator banger. Just plan to be sleep afterward from being so super full. 

Make sure to stop by the next time you're in Chicago, and if you've already been - go back! Love this place!"
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Elizabeth H.,"Great neighborhood bar. We reserved the back room for a party of ~30 people which was a perfect space to get our friends together. The service was excellent - Michael was so busy with making the rounds to continuously get drink and food orders all night and he did a phenomenal job. We were all so impressed with how attentive he was! We also appreciated that the bar let us all keep our own tabs open and separate - and we had drink specials since it was a bigger group. Highly recommend! Food was all very good, too. We recommend the pork nachos, burgers, and fried mac & cheese app - though everyone enjoyed everything ordered off of the menu. Cannot say enough nice things about how easy it was to reserve and have a group of friends here for a fun night out."
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Misty S.,"Here's what you need to know:
-Easy street parking
-Get the Duck Grinder
-$5 burger on Wednesday

As for the details, I came on Wednesday night and the place was packed!  There was plenty of outdoor seating open, but it was a bit chilly.  I sat by the bar waiting for my friend and the bartender served me up a cup of water right away.  I must have been thirsty because the water was gone before my friend arrived, but the bartender promptly refilled it even though I haven't ordered anything yet.  That's pretty great service.  

I was able to snag a table after a few minutes of being there.  Unbeknownst to me at the time, there's another section of the restaurant with more tables in the back past the bathrooms.  It's way brighter in there, though.  The music was good (well, if you like pop music), but very loud, which cause the people to talk loudly making it very loud overall.  The waitress was pretty great - friendly and helpful.

Duck Grinder $12 - I swore off ordering duck anywhere outside Chinatown after having eaten some disappointing duck dishes.  I was on the fence about trying it here, but reading the review convinced me to try it and it was awesome!  This shredded duck with its garlic aioli served on a piece of pillowy bread blew my taste buds away.  The steak fries were good, too.  I'll come back for this grinder.

Slice Chunky Monkey Pie $6 - I was so looking forward to trying this concoction...but unfortunately they ran out.  Guess I'll have to come back for more tasty beer and yummy grinder."
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,LaDarian D.,"An industry good time. Good beer, good crew, a couple of laughs & a great time. Stumbled in with friends & stumbled out the same. No complaints from me. Thanks guys."
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Stephanie L.,"3.5 but whatevs
Great little neighborhood spot.

We took my Aunt and Uncle here for a bite to eat on NY day.  
Mac N Cheese bites-pretty good...I was expecting more to the homemade goodies.
Chee-Vap-good, but kind of dry and awkward to eat...am I supposed to roll it?  Bite off it?  Is there sauce on here?
Burger-very average.  All the fries were the fat fries that I love...but they all tasted stale.

The place was bumping so our server was kind of a miss.

Overall, seems like a great neighborhood bar...not really sold on the food.  Maybe if we came here to drink..."
the-aberdeen-tap-chicago-2,Yayo T.,"Very cool pub and grub spot. Their food is above your frozen fare you find in a bar, and the drinks are delicious. Aberdeen Tap has a great outdoor seating area, and they have large garage door type windows that open up to allow the beauty of summer to flow through. 

The crowd is pretty diverse, since most walk over from the neighborhood. Pop in for food and drinks, you will not be disappointed."
sullys-house-chicago,Lauran D.,"Sully's has a lot of space and a really nice private event space upstairs with an awesome rooftop patio I got to enjoy last summer.  The bar is large and has plenty of seating.  There is a back room with large screens which is perfect for watching during game days.  The draft list is on point and all the drinks are super reasonably priced.  I have only had extremely nice and helpful servers!  Always have to get the Basco sticks and ranch!!!  If you are a ranch person, it is a must try!  I will go back time and time again."
sullys-house-chicago,Shay R.,"Sully's House is what you would picture when you think of a college sports bar. I've been to Sully's for a Bears game and recently for a night of drinking.

The inside of Sully's is dark (i.e. dark paint, furniture, etc.) but they have a lot of seats and tv's. My friends and I visited on a Saturday night before the place got really crowded. The front of the house was packed but the back was completely empty. 

My friends and I were glad that the drinks were reasonably priced. Make sure you're extra nice to the bartenders because they definitely will show favoritism when dishing out drinks. I noticed some people were able to get the same drink but in different glasses for the same price.

The music they were playing was great for a Saturday night. I can see Sully's coming more alive later in the evening. I can see myself coming back here when I'm in the neighborhood and craving a cheap drink."
sullys-house-chicago,Mandy J.,"Stopped in after doing some shopping at REI.  Seems like a decent corner pub.  Fairly small, but seemed to draw a crowd of regulars around 9 PM on a Monday night.  We ordered a pitcher of Miller Lite (only $12...can't go wrong with that!) and some food.  I liked my turkey BLT, but the tots weren't great.  I think the grease in the fryer needed to be changed.  They tasted a little off.  The service was good and lots of tvs to watch whatever sporting event suits your fancy.  I don't think I'd go out of my way to stop by here again, but I wouldn't avoid it or caution against it."
sullys-house-chicago,Daniel S.,"Pretty much your standard dive bar, we went here after checking out the new Off Color Brewery tap room just down the street. We were able to get a bucket of Coors here for $16 and end the night. No frills but it got the job done"
sullys-house-chicago,Kelsey T.,"A hidden gem off the beaten path. This place is legit. Their drink selection is pretty decent and have $4 draft goose island, and their signature sully sticks (essentially cheesy bread with marinara and ranch) are half off!

Is this a destination dinner venue? Probably not, but I'm not gonna knock it until I come back and eat a full meal here. However, they have an awesome rooftop patio with couches and tvs, and you won't find a better bang for your.l buck nearly anywhere in Chicago if you're looking for a good happy hour deal on Friday's!"
sullys-house-chicago,Karolina T.,"This was my second time here.  My boyfriend and I, well really it was just my boyfriend, wanted to watch the Dayton basketball game but the Dayton bar was already packed so we decided on Sully's because it's easy to find parking and close by.  We were worried that they wouldn't want to put on the game for us because it was 7pm Friday night and both the Bulls and Hawks were playing, but surprisingly the bartender had no issue with it!  The place wasn't super slammed but fairly busy.  I really like the bar atmosphere in general.  It's pretty mellow and got more busy as the night went on.  Anyways, I did not really enjoy the food.  I had the pulled pork quesadillas and b=my boyfriend had the Sully's BLT.  Just your typical greasy bar food, nothing wrong with that though."
sullys-house-chicago,Dan K.,"The appetizers were ok.  The ""main"" courses were horrendous.  For example, had the steak wrap.  Steak was burned to a crisp and dry.  Food took forever.  Will not be going back."
sullys-house-chicago,Gus L.,Great sports bar with some great specials. Bartenders are friendly and unpretentious and the food is pretty good. Can get busy on a Friday night but a great spot for the game after work or a happy hour with friends. The rooftop is decent too.
sullys-house-chicago,Meghan N.,"My fianc√© and his friends love coming here every Sunday during football season which means I am also a frequent attendee. The usual bartender Issac is awesome and a cool dude. Justin is another bartender we've been seeing lately and he has been 100% adequate. The bar-mate next to me asked for a hot cocoa after my hot toddy looked so good. Justin said they don't have hot cocoa so he made a cocoa-martini. I was somewhat involved in the order and showed interest in her drink he made up. Without me asking, Justin ended up giving me a bit of the leftovers from the shaker he used to make her drink. Sully's has an excellent draft beer selection as well as an extensive whiskey selection. They also have many beer bottles and cans on display and are not lacking in the other liquor availabilities. They have the ability to make hot toddy's which can be hard to find in a local sports bar. The meatball sandwich, steak quesadilla and homemade potato chips are all amazing from personal experience. My fianc√©'s good friend always seems to order the Italian beef and is always satisfied. My fianc√© has been happy with the BLT. My critical reviews: the pizza has a nice texture but not enough flavor. I need to add hot sauce to make it tasty. Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes were not served with the pizza. The wings smell amazing but if you look close, you may find hairs still attached to the wing. I thought that maybe this was a fluke since I have heard others enjoying them but I believe those people may have been drunk and/or hungry enough to not notice because many months after my hairy wing experience, a plate of wings were delivered to the bar-mate next to me. The smell made me turn my head with my mouth watering but I could see the hairs coming through the sauce. All in all I come here time and time again. Hopefully this review will help them fix their few hang-ups."
sullys-house-chicago,Christine K.,Went here for a bday in the summer - their patio upstairs is extremely underrated ! Really nice patio furniture and we were basically the only people up there for the entire day drink. Service was really good and regular prices were good as well. The bartender was funny and really attentive - especially handling all 40 people to himself . Would go here in the summer 200%
sullys-house-chicago,Brittany L.,"This is the best bar in the city. I have lived in the area going on 3+ years and this bar has never once been less than expected. I thought I was biased due to my location, but my friends have been requesting Sully's when they live up north. Their food is better than an average bar, they have amazing employees, pop a shot AND it is dog friendly outdoors... need I say more?"
sullys-house-chicago,Rose Anne G.,"We stumbled into Sully's House on a Saturday night while looking for a parking spot...I'm glad we did! It is a cool little bar with a nice atmosphere and super friendly service. This fun little place has the regular bar area and a large back section as well.  
Lots of TV's for sports and not a bad place to sit in the house. We sat at the bar itself, the bartender was quick with a drink (and a light of my smoke... Kidding... Channeling Billy Joel!) and makes a mean ""Old Fashion!""  In addition, they have a good selection of beer on tap. 
Parking around the bar is free and within walking distance to other bars in the area."
sullys-house-chicago,John D.,"I walked in with my friend today to get lunch.  We were the only people there and we sat at the bar.  I was excited to try a new place out in the neighborhood, then I met the bartender.  She hated us immediately and I found her attitude to be quite unwarranted.  We were quiet, respectable, reasonable, and gracious towards her and she decided to treat us like second rate human beings.  On top of the unnecessary treatment she was drinking on the job at the ripe hour of 3pm.  Never coming back here again.  I take pride in my ability to be kind and courteous.  Her attitude was so offensive, I'll never spend another penny there.  November 16th 2017"
sullys-house-chicago,Sabra B.,I love this place so much!!! Their chicken & bacon wrap is addictive. I love it so much paired with the tots & spicy mayo dipping sauce. I'm a martini girl & their dirty martinis are the perfect combo of strong & smooth. Their rooftop is chill and their workers are all super nice & fun. I am lucky enough to have this place right outside my doorstop. I will keep coming back for the good atmosphere and delish food!
sullys-house-chicago,Kyle L.,"Nice bar close to the theaters. Had the lamb burger. It was a decent burger, nothing to write home about, or Yelp I guess. I'd suggest this place if you're looking for a decently priced burger and beer."
sullys-house-chicago,Alfreda D.,"After all of these years I finally made it into Sully's. It's the sponsor bar for Chicago Sports and Social and I play basketball next door every week. Anyway, my team rolled through after our game to chill for a few. It's dimly lit with a bunch of TVs lined up around the main bar area to the left. There's also a separate dining area to the right when you walk in.

Jason/Justin (ugh, I can't believe I forgot his name!) was very nice and welcomed our sweaty/possibly smelly selves into the bar. CSS gives out discount cards to all participants to enjoy specials at Sully's. There were deals on a couple of drinks and Corona buckets. The food specials were for every day other than Sunday of course! The prices were reasonable to begin with but half off wings would've been the truth! I got them anyway, and they were good. They have buffalo, bbq and naked, also jumbo or boneless. We shared the nachos and cheese sticks with marinara sauce. Basically, everything was good. And the other guy, Andy, was super sweet and nice. He was attentive and at our table helping us out with any questions, TV requests, HVAC requests, like anything. Thanks man!"
sullys-house-chicago,Rocky P.,"WINGS to die for.

THe food and drinks, along with a 30-10 victory for the Gators made this stop  a five star."
sullys-house-chicago,Tyler G.,Great neighborhood Bar! Also very accommodating for large private parties. I highly recommend Sullys house!
sullys-house-chicago,Joe F.,"Went here for a birthday party for a wristband deal. Let's start with what I liked about it-

* really awesome upstairs. They have an inside/ outside type of deal where there's a bar on the inside with tv's and bathrooms and then the actual rooftop is really cool. Two big cabana type places under the shade of big umbrellas with tv's outside and other tables to sit at.

* bartender and wait staff were nice

Now for why 2 stars- 

* it was $35 for all you can drink and eat (pizza, wings, tater tots) from 3-6 aka their slow time, which is where I start to have a problem. We probably had around 30 people attend this thing (honestly maybe more) and there were absolutely zero accommodations for us despite the fact we made up the large majority of their business during that time. They made it seem like we would have the rooftop reserved for us, which it wasn't, so you had about 8 people taking up both cabana spots on a 90 degree day with the only available spots in the shade while the rest of our large party were standing in the sun. Again, they made it seem like we had SOMETHING reserved. 

Furthermore- they didn't start feeding us until about an hour and a half in. They put out about four pizzas for all 30 of us and the size was smaller than your typical frozen pizza. Really? We waited 90 minutes for that. After that, they brought out food I think two more times. I'm not even sure they cooked enough wings to let everyone have one a piece. If that's built into the price of the wristband the I would at least like to have my money's worth. I don't even care about the quality, which wasn't good either. 

It's a cool spot but I would never recommend going here for a predetermined party. They're obviously cheap if they treat a bunch of 26-28 year old people with plenty of disposable income like they did. 

See ya never again sully's!"
sullys-house-chicago,Jess C.,"We had some friends in town who are Gator fans.  We searched out a Gator bar to watch the Gator/Kentucky basketball game and found Sully's.  There were four of us and we sat at the bar.  We were greeted nicely by Isaac who remained our bartender/server/entertainer for the next several hours.   The service was friendly and we all felt welcome.  The drinks were good, and food was even better.  We had wings, Greek lamb wrap, Sully Sticks and everything was fresh and yummy. We look forward to coming back in the warmer weather when the rooftop deck is open.   Thanks bartender Isaac for making our first visit very enjoyable!"
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Tanvi S.,"One of our fav Thai spots in Chicago, mainly cuz they have sushi as well. They make customized sushi rolls, which is key for us as vegetarians so we can enjoy something fancy outside the usual cucumber, avocado rolls :). Their pad thai and panang curry is also spot on. 

Based on the location (like this one), i'd recommend getting reservations. 

Bonus: it's BYOB and there is no corkage fee!"
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Amanda R.,"We used to go to Butterfly sushi all the time! You couldn't keep us away. But their prices have increased way beyond what they should have in a short amount of time. A summer roll went from $7 to $10 in less than a year. I think that's a bit excessive on the price increases. Same with other items. The price increase doesn't even make it worth driving the extra that we did when we can get something good at a lower price without traveling so much. I guess they don't care about their customer base that made them what they are. Food is good, but the prices have now made it like any other sushi restaurant.

Bye bye Butterfly"
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Jenn H.,"Above average sushi and friendly and attentive staff! This is a neighborhood favorite that is consistently good. 

We most recently visited on a Saturday night. It was crowded but we had a reservation and didn't have to wait long for our table. 

We started with the shrimp tempura and the spinach pot stickers. The shrimp tempura is lightly battered and crispy. It also comes with some tempura veggies, which are also very tasty. The pot stickers were okay; I'd probably go with the shrimp ones next time as the spinach ones consisted of some sort of cream in the middle that I could have done without. 

We ordered a variety of sushi rolls for the table. They all come out very fancy with their own lighting for each plate. Very cool presentation and the rolls were tasty too. 

Service was excellent. Our girl helped us pick out the rolls and made some recommendations. She was there when we needed her, but not overbearing. They let us hang out for a few and finish our wine, and we didn't feel rushed.

Recommend this place if you're looking for a casual BYO spot to grab sushi."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Belle L.,"Thai Food is a better option.  Hit-n-Miss Food.  Neighborhood place.  River North pricing.  Easy $30pp, no brown bag.  :-(

SKIP the chain consistent THAI ESCARGOT with an unbalanced, too sweet sauce.  10 escargots, $1 each.

SKIP the $7 SOFT SHELL CRAB with yellow coating fried onions.  Since the onions are useless, you basically pay $7 for one small crab.  Decently fried, could be better.

Decent $8 TORO for 1 piece.  Ouch.  Thawed correctly.  Nice presentation.  Looks better than others.  A ok for taste.

1-Star less:  (1) quality does not equal price; (2) ALL 3 menus have soy sauce spots or some sticky stuff on it even though laminated with plastic.  Wanna wipe them once a day?; (3) smaller than usual soy sauce dipping container.

SERVICE is friendly and decent.  Beautiful VENUE.  Tight seating even though it has square footage."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Tina M.,"I've had a better spicy tuna roll at the grocery store...IM NOT KIDDING. The rice was wet and it was almost like eating tuna wrapped in glue. YES...GLUE! Gross. The cashew chicken I ordered was fried and nowhere on the menu did it say fried. HORRIBLE. On a plus side the woman who took my order was delightful. Wish I could say that about the meal.....
If your looking for sushi in the area try Sushi X on Chicago Ave . I've never had a bad experience there."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Brent W.,"Another place i've enjoyed several times over the years but lacks a review. Butterfly is a stalwart among the Sushi spots in the West Loop/Noble Sq/Uk Village area and for good reason. They consistently put out awesome sushi with their unique Butterfly flair and have outstanding service to match. 

I came recently with a friend who used to work here and knew the owner/our servers. We were treated like royalty and given comp one-off rolls after another.  But the sleeper dish of the eve was not even sushi, it was the amazing Spicy Crazy Noodle. If you love pan fried noodles done to perfection, this is your go-to. You choose from Soba or Wide noodle (go for the wide on this) stir-fried with onion, egg plant, basil leaves, string bean and hot pepper in brown sauce. So darn good.

[X] One of Chicago's best imo"
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Vincent D.,"Came here with a friend after debating the two Butterfly Sushi locations because this one had better reviews. We ordered the yellowtail and scallion roll as well as a samurai roll. The presentation of the rolls were great as it came out surrounding a cool sculpture. However, the food itself left much to be desired. The sushi rice wasn't particularly good. It wasn't very warm nor did it not have the slight taste of vinegar or sweetness that you attribute to sushi rice. The samurai roll was the best of the two and had jam on it. It was advertised this way, but I was still taken aback at how sweet it was compared to the rest of the roll and didn't think it complimented it that well. The yellowtail roll really didn't taste very good at all. It didn't taste fresh and had an offputting texture to it.

We left pretty promptly after finishing what we could of our food and I don't see myself coming back here. There's better sushi in the city with the same price point."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Michael C.,"My family and I are always looking for some great thai and sushi places. How can you get both without sacrificing quality? Butterfly Thai. 

Been here a couple of times now and everytime they deliver some amazing food! Given that they did raise the price a bit, I also think that they stepped up their game. Definitely no complaints.

ALL their curries are great and I definitely suggest the panang and red catfish curry. Their sushi rolls are all decorated so beautifully with their sauces making it absolutely mesmerizing. The seafood salad is plentiful and flavorful. Finally, their basil fried rice is FANTASTIC. At the end they even gave us a complimentary cheesecake dessert! 

Overall definitely an all time favorite, truly never disappoints. The interior is beautiful yet casual. And the staff are AMAZING. Our server, the hostess, everyone was so kind. Definitely stop by when you get the chance."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Tatiana M.,"Hands down, our favorite thai/sushi place in Chicago! 

I know pad thai is the most basic thing anyone can order, but I cannot go here without ordering it. It's truly the best chicken pad thai I have ever had in my life, and from any city. And they give you these mini plastic containers of red chili oil which adds the best kick to the dish. Just enough heat to make you want to finish the entire plate. Oh and the portions are HUGE. For $9, you get dinner and then leftovers for lunch the next day. (Currently salivating as I'm typing.)

Also, their gyoza is top notch. Their egg rolls are amazing. I guess it's not really fair to critique those because anything fried is going to be amazing, let's be real.

As for sushi, I personally don't eat sushi, but all of my friends and family rave about it. If you plan on dining there, it's BYOB which makes me wish I can give them 6 stars! Great for big groups or for a casual date night."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Helene K.,"This is probably my last resort before coming here again! The food was such low quality tonight, I ordered Thai food to go, not any sushi items. However, it was just so bad! The pad Thai had 4 pieces of shrimp, noodles were so dry that all of the sauce was absorbed. No peanuts on top like I had asked. The fried rice with shrimp had all frozen veggies that had become smashed and tasteless when you ate it.then I ordered the broccoli with shrimp and what did you know 2 lbs of broccoli go with 4 pc of shrimp, at least that had fresh broccoli in it. But nothing else such a boring entree! If I wanted vegetarian I get it, but when I paid $45 almost for all rice and broccoli but where was the shrimp or wow factor in any dish that I ordered. Nowhere to be found! I swear Panda Express gives you more and oddly that tastes better than this ""upscale"" Thai joint in the west loop! The local Thai places, to me have issues with cleanliness and this one just doesn't get the food right in my opinion. All I can say is sushi would be great here 5 months ago but tonight, I really hated what they gave me. I was still left with the feeling that I should have gone somewhere else..."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Jessie Elizabeth J.,"This is one of my favorite BYOB sushi and Thai joints! Reasonably priced large portions with fresh food and atmosphere.

The Panang Curry is out of this world-creamy, spicy, and with a depth of flavor you will not be expecting. It is delicious in their Thai escargot appetizer (served with tender snails and frsh basil leaves swimming in the savory sauce and served with thick cuts of buttery garlic toast) and also with your choice of meat (I usually do chicken as it absorbs the flavor so well). 

The sushi here is very inventive as well as tasty-the specialty rolls are chock full of interesting combinations and one roll can be a gratifying meal. 
MY favorite so far is the signature Butterfly Maki which has shrimp tempura, cream cheese, cucumber, unagi, masago, and tempura crumbs with eel sauce-a little bit of everything. 

Don't underestimate their regular Maki though, the Salmon Skin is smoky and meaty yet crisped, and the Spicy Tuna is plump with meat that is never fishy or tough and a good ratio of spice to fish. 

Rice is always on point whether for your curry or sushi!

The space itself is very pristine and great for groups or a date. It feels so classy without being intimidating for a casual dinner. 

Also, it's BYOB which is the fish roe on top. Small wonder they have 3 locations, but this is my favorite space."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Sarah S.,"My homie and I were netflixing & chilling (in the most literal way possible as we're platonic friends) some Terrace House and got that hankering for a little somethin' somethin'. There is never a time I'll turn down sushi, so we checked out Postmates and Butterfly fit the bill. 

I have a bit of a sweet potato maki obsession so surely had to try Butterfly's and see how it measured up to other sushi joints. I'm happy to say their $6 sweet potato maki was full of goodness that pleased my tummy. The maki mono had the sweet potato pieces deep fried with a unagi sauce over the roll giving it just the right sweetness.

Now I thought that was good, but when I tasted some of my beastly million ingredient roll, I knew I had found my sushi heaven. The Fire Dragon Maki for $14 is what I lovingly refer to as a white girl roll. It has everything terrible you can possibly put in a roll for one amazingly unhealthy but delicious taste. The Fire Dragon Maki is a deep-fried battered seaweed roll filled with salmon tempura, spicy tuna, cream cheese, avocado, sweet potato, scallion, spicy honey-mayo, and topped with wasabi & golden tobiko. I'm talking piles and pilesof tobiko! It added the perfect crunch to this packing a spicy punch roll. 

People. I swear. I fell in love with that Fire Dragon Roll over the weekend. 

I know you think I'm already a monster...but I swear to you I did not eat this all it one sitting! I swear it! I did however end my meal with a Taro Bubble Tea for $5.50 which was the perfect nightcap to my feast of fish.

If you're doing the Netflix & Chill thang and need some soosh to satisfy your craving, Butterfly should fit your bill. They have three locations so they'll surely be able to service you in the city."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Joe H.,"For my roommates and I, this is our go-to takeout spot. The massaman curry and the cashew tofu dishes are highlights. The sushi is also quality. Though we primarily takeout, the service when we dine in is always friendly."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Ganga S.,"Delicious sushi, noodles, and drinks! They have one of the best bubble teas that i've had in Chicago, aside from chinatown. I came with a bunch of friends and we all loved our dishes. Each dish was unique, and very flavorful. Probably my favorite sushi + asian fusion downtown. There is something on the menu for everyone. The presentation is also on point. The food looked almost too beautiful to destroy."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Kanan D.,"We can back here for father's day! Again enjoyed my meal extremely! For appetizers, we got Fried tofu and they suggested for me to try the Godzilla sushi vegetarian.  Man oh man! THIS WAS BOMB! It was so delicious.  I could have probably just eaten this and finished my dinner! We also ordered the Spicy Crazy noodles and it was again delicious and the basil fried rice which was alright nothing to rave about.  Excellent service, and even better food what else can you ask for!"
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Pudge B.,"Been going here for close to three years. Service is always prompt friendly and clean, and food quality is consistent. Amazing value for the ambience and menu"
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Salvador H.,"Delicious! The location is in a nice part of town. Parking was a little rough. But, after a good 20 minutes of driving in circles we finally found a spot. The staff was very friendly and attentive. The restaurant is BYOB, so we brought our own beers. Visually the restaurant looks amazing the seating is comfortable and spacious. I order the red curry with tofu. This dish was so good. It was citrusy and savory with coconut tones and whole baby tomatoes and pineapple chunks. It was so good I honestly didn't want to finish it all so I could have some for later. As an appetizer I ordered edamame it came with a light sprinkle of salt I added a little bit of lemon and it was delicious. My friend ordered the chicken cashew. He thought it was very good. All in all I will definitely be coming back and inviting friends. Very satisfied customer."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Kat L.,"If you want some fancy sushi, this is the place to go. Plates are beautiful, decorated with saucy swirls.  Because of that, I'd recommend opting out of an extra side of spicy mayo (which is a typical side order for me). I think their swirls are made of unagi sauce, spicy mayo, and regular mayo (if it's not cream cheese, or wasabi mayo...) 

Average larger/fusion rolls range from $12-18, and your classics are typically $6-8. The ambience is definitely good for date night/girls night, although i wouldn't recommend a group of more than 4.  It's a little darker with hip music and a classy vibe. 

You won't get your freebies here (like miso soup, veggies, or a ginger salad.) 

It's BYOB. Come for some pretty rolls and drinks and robata bites. They have ramen on the menu too. 

It's definitely a spot id come back to for vibe alone, and to continually try new things. Haha expect to come back, cuz this place could easily run up a dinner bill. Still, a win.  You might even luck out with free street parking"
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Naureen N.,"Terrible service. When we arrived, there was no hostess. There were several open tables and at least 25 people waiting at the door.  Once the hostess returned she wouldn't give us an answer as to how long the wait would be. She would just look at us and walk away. This happened for at least 35 min before we decided to go somewhere else. If you're going to hire a hostess, perhaps she should have the decency to answer questions instead of telling you to hold on for  35 min and ignoring your existence. I will most defintely never come back here again."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-2,Jenny H.,"We specifically travelled to the Grand location because it had better reviews. However, the sushi was disappointing and left us hungry. Ordered the yellowtail and scallion roll and my friend ordered the samurai special roll. The yellowtail roll was chopped to the texture of canned tuna and had a fishy flavor, hinting at not being of the freshest grade. The rice was dense, dry, and not well flavored. The samurai roll was better, but bizarre with a jam aftertaste finish. The theatrics to display the sushi were beautiful; carved ice and colorful lights shining through, but would have traded it all for better quality fish. About 15 min after eating, felt a bit queasy in the stomach. Not interested in coming back."
the-silver-palm-chicago,Olivia M.,"The restaurant where you can eat in a train car! How cool! I have to start by saying that the service is always great. Bartenders and servers alike are very accommodating and charismatic. 

I must confess that I mainly come here for the drinks. In my mother's opinion (my mother has been drinking solely lemon drops for the past 30+ years) this place has the best lemon drop in the city and I happen to agree with her. Powered sugar rim, fresh squeezed lemon juice, and a mini jug with more martini, what's not to love? 

As far as food goes I have only had the three little piggy sandwich once or twice. It was very good but I never get around to diving into their menu so I do not have much to review on that topic. Highly recommend coming for the drinks."
the-silver-palm-chicago,David W.,"After years, I finally made it here to try the famous 3 Little Piggy sandwich. My wife and I enjoyed! We split it. The sandwich definitely gets an A for Authentic. I was surprised that the sandwich was not sloppy and falling over my hands. You could actually taste every ingredient in the sandwich. We also had a side of onion rings which were very good! Once again the onion did not come out of the fried pocket once bitten into. Excellent and I definitely recommend! We had the Mac and cheese which was good. Finally, we had the chocolate lava cake. It was ok at best. 
Staff was friendly. I recommend not sitting in the rear of the restaurant. Not sure if it's the cook or not but workers kept going in and out of the back door which was a little disturbing. 
Also, the restaurant does have tv in the bar part."
the-silver-palm-chicago,Kyle Martin D.,"Four fat Michigan slobs trudged their way through the club car's narrow path. Our labored breathing and the sound of our thighs rubbing together through our overstuffed cargo shorts would undoubtedly be just as loud as the train's roaring engine, if this train, which is connected to this fine dining establishment, was actually running. 

The club car is dim, dingy and served as the perfect way to cap a weekend ruining this great town with our unsightly presence. 

We all ordered booze. Gimlets. Sweet, sugary, delicious gimlets that paired well with my veggie burger (which was fine) and the Three Little Piggies sandwiches my friends ordered because they wish to leave this godforsaken planet before they reach their 50s. 

My friends said the sandwich was solid, but questioned celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain, who named it as one of the top sandwiches in all of the land. 

Regardless, this place is worth checking out. 

Booze, sweat and stumble your way out of an incredibly narrow club car before heading back down to the equally narrow bar for playful banter with the friendly bartenders and drinks to keep you on track for a glorious time."
the-silver-palm-chicago,Sean S.,"I went there for my birthday to try something different.  There is a bar which leads into a train car from the early 1940's.  Train atmosphere was good, bar was dimly lit and both were cool-cold.  The staff turned up the heat when requested.

Our server, Albert, was very nice.  We had the salmon with mashed potatoes and asparagus.  Salmon & asparagus were ok and mashed potatoes were good.  For desert, we shared a piece of the lava cake, which they put in a candle for my birthday wish.  It was good.  

We plan on going back and trying some of their appetizers and/or a different entree."
the-silver-palm-chicago,Nick G.,The only reason anyone should walk into this place is to try the three piggy sandwich. Its on point! but other things on the menu were not just okay.
the-silver-palm-chicago,Brooke S.,"Typical greasy spoon with giant portions. The Three Piggies is a massive sandwich and shouldn't be eaten by one person unless you are ambitious. They have gluten free options (sandwich with no bread), but its something. Good prices, and they stay open late."
the-silver-palm-chicago,David J.,"When you get there you'll understand. The Silver Palm is 1920-30s cool. The restaurant has an atmosphere which makes you want to sip their legendary manhattans or perfect sidecars all night. With a long wooden bar which seems to extend forever, and a club car from a train as the dining room, this place is vintage cool. 

The menu has incredible food, and their Three Little Piggies is incredible. Get the tots with it, and make it every foodies perfect night. 

Service is great. Everyone is friendly. Food is surprisingly fast, yet cooked to perfection. The bartender made drinks like a pro. I could spend a whole night here, and then some."
the-silver-palm-chicago,Ian C.,"Went here on Saturday night for some drinks and to check out the famous train car.  

Place was pretty busy and lively with good music and a few TV's with the games on.  Nice small bar atmosphere with a nice crowd, very friendly and seems to have set of regulars for sure.  Definately a place for younger crowd, just out for a drink or two.

Drinks are reasonable, about $8-10 a drink and the sizes were per usual what you'd expect.  Good quality alcohol and good quantity of variety.  I got a Moscow Mule, which had great taste and a nice bite to it with the ginger beer and lime juice. 

Only downside is that the guy who was behind the bar wasn't the best bartender and was a bit slow, otherwise it was good. 

Definately will come back and have some more drinks and laughs at this spot."
the-silver-palm-chicago,Mihir S.,"This is kind of a gem. When you enter the restaurant from the street it's like entering any other restaurant or store. But once you step into the dining room, you're actually in an old train car. 

Service is nice and knowledgeable but a little slow. Food is very fresh, generous, and affordable. I got the sandwich that is supposedly Anthony Bourdain's favorite - has pork loin, ham and bacon, My bacon was missing though. Drinks are good and inexpensive.

I'll be back to try the Louisana fried chicken. FYI, it takes 45 minutes to make!"
the-silver-palm-chicago,Andrew D.,"Bourdain can be a bit of an elitist douche (not surprising for New Yorkers...), but he found a goldmine with the Three Little Piggies sandwich! While it may prompt a heart attack or two, the sandwich is delicious! All three variations of pork are properly cooked and complement each other perfectly. 

Solid, affordable beer list, friendly staff, and it's so charming with the train car base! A bit of a hidden gem since it's on an unassuming corner, but I'll definitely be returning here, and to the sister bar, the Matchbox."
the-silver-palm-chicago,Thomas T.,This place is delicious and beautiful. More restaurants need to follow their example and serve food on a train car.
the-silver-palm-chicago,Tina N.,"We do this stuff all the time, go out for a big dinner & hit other spots on the way home. By the time we're on the way home, I am so full I can't breathe! 

That said, pants unbuttoned or not, I am so very happy we stopped in here!

Go big or go home, right?! Right. 
Here we go! Walking through the front of the house onto the train car was a pretty cool experience. It's not like I've never been on a train before but it felt different. I can't describe it. 

So we ordered a few of their fancy schmancy drinks (can't remember the names) & off to ordering we went. 
Here's what we decided to share:
Pork belly 
Asparagus 
3 piggy

Alright. So , the pork belly wasn't cooked the right way & was very dry. It was nothing like we're used to & I was very disappointed. 
I was nervous moving on to the 3 piggy after how the pork belly was but fear not, my friend... That sandwich was out of this world! I don't understand how it went from one extreme to the next, but it did & you need to eat it. Like as soon as you can! 

So although the belly wasn't as amazing as the 3 piggy, I think we'll be back to try other menu offerings. If all else fails, that 3 piggy is worth the stop!"
the-silver-palm-chicago,David A.,The three little piggies sandwich is everything and more for the pork fan. Decadent and delicious to the max. My wife got the buttermilk fried chicken and it was spicy and moist - two of my favorite things. The martinis flowed generously and we enjoyed sitting on an actual train. It was a great experience with outstanding food.
the-silver-palm-chicago,Ruggy J.,"I'm willing to bet some people have no idea they've ever had a drink at Silver Palm. One would just imagine you're simply enjoying Matchbox's sidewalk patio, but lo and behold, The Silver Palm is more than just the namesake caboose that sits idly behind Matchbox. It's the operating business bringing you food and drink when you sit outside near the intersection of Chicago and Milwaukee. 

For all intents and purposes, I can't tell the difference between the two (aside from the outdoor seating). If you like Matchbox, you're probably going to like The Silver Palm as well."
the-silver-palm-chicago,Chris M.,Bartenders on Thursday nights are not personable. Talk about an awkward crappy place.
the-silver-palm-chicago,Ella R.,"We just left the Silver Palm, we all had a delicious meal!!
Everyone had something completely different and all were equally good!! I had grilled salmon and the best roasted vegetables I have ever had!! Ribs, sandwiches, and salads.  The fried onion rings, and tater tots, yummy. Please open one in LA!!!"
the-silver-palm-chicago,Karen G.,"Wonderful!!  They even had a wheelchair lift so my mom could get inside without climbing the stairs.

I had the fried chicken- crispy and tasty. My husband had the little piggy which I had some of- huge and full of pig goodness. The beer selection varied and all good and the service very nice.

I also enjoyed the cheese sticks- fresh and some of the best I've had. 

I would definitely come back."
the-silver-palm-chicago,Katie D.,"Only drawback is the subpar, incredibly slow service. Get ready to spend 2+ hours here. 45 mins to get a glass of wine, 45 mins to get the check. And then they included gratuity after basically ignoring us. They also wouldn't split the check. The rail car is super cute. And the cocktails are great, but not worth waiting 45 mins for."
the-silver-palm-chicago,Sonia W.,"The food here is orgasmic. The cocktails are divine. The setting is unique and unlike any other in Chicago. Totally worth checking out even if, like me, you don't eat pork so you can't indulge in Anthony Bourdain's favorite sandwich."
the-silver-palm-chicago,Sarah S.,"Finding the entrance of The Silver Palm is way confusing for first timers! I was one such newbie when I went this past weekend and thankfully some gentleman on the street pointed us in the right direction. The Silver Palm is one of the cooler atmospheres for dining being in a silver train car...but you enter around the corner from where you see the train car. 

I've had The Silver Palm on my list for awhile since they are Anthony Bourdain approved. And when I went, I had to get their Three Little Pigs sandwich which Bourdain proclaimed as the ""Best Sandwich in America""! I gotta say...he may just be right. It's beastly and indulgent and you won't be able to eat it in one sitting. At least I sure couldn't. The Three Little Pigs is a layer of cheese, topped with breaded pork, stacked with an insane amount of thick delicious ham, crispy bacon curls on top of that, then a fried eggs that has a nice runny center, one big deep fried onion ring,then more cheese on a bun. When you put it all together, its stacked so darn high...the only way to fit it in a mouth is by pressing it down a bit or taking out some of the meats. It's good though. Real good. Makes my mouth water just thinking about it good. It's $13.95 and comes with a side. I did the tater tots and really liked those, as well.

I had one of their cocktails that cost me $13 and seemed a few bucks overpriced. It was decent though. We also tried the butternut squash soup which was also just okay....it was more chunky than expected. I'm used to a creamy version of this but it was aiight.

Our server was robotic but I saw some other servers that were super friendly, outgoing and engaged so I think ours was just having an off night. 

I'm so glad I finally got to The Silver Palm and that sandwich made the whole trip worthwhile!"
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Natalia K.,"I made a reservation here on a Friday night thinking it would be packed, but when we walked in, we were only one of two tables in the entire restaurant. I am wondering if this is more of a brunch place and only recently opened for dinner hours. Anyway, I came because they had a rib-eye on the menu and that is what I was craving for the evening. The waiter was a little rusty on his beers and offered me a coffee with tequila and soda water as a substitute for Guinness. Ummm no. I then decided on a Krombacher because to me a pilsner is more of a substitute for a Guinness than a heavier milk stout. It might just be me, but I consider Guinness light in substance and abv and all that. But that's probably just me. Regardless, the waiter called my choice ""low-brow!"" It was certainly an interesting start to the evening.

Anyway, we tried a guacamole appetizer and the presentation was wonderful with plantain and root chips bursting out of the bowl. It was good and we finished it quickly. My steak was a little tough to eat, even at medium rare, and my asparagus tips were the size of trees, so I wondered how old they were, but it was a decent meal. The waiter offered us free dessert, which we tried. It was chocolate chip pancakes and they were just ok. A little too heavy after what I had just eaten. He also offered us beers to go, in coffee cups, which we gladly accepted. We also saw a large number of beautifully decorate gingerbread houses and that was lovely for whomever ordered them. Decent food and service with a (sassy) smile--that's what counts."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Ebony S.,"Review: Decided to try this place out because of the raving reviews. Arrived for a late brunch around 2pm. There was no wait and I was able to get free street parking in front of the place so that worked out perfectly. The service was good but I know I just ordered the wrong thing for me. I ordered the lemon pancakes and the were very dry and not hot at all. I was in a rush and had to see a play so I couldn't take the order back. My husband ordered the salmon hash which was pretty good. I am basing my review on my experience and meal which is why there is a 3 star review. I do hope to try it again so hopefully this review will be updated. 

Budget: $18 for 2 with Dining Out

Food: Salmon Hash and Lemon pancakes"
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Maria M.,"I would give Kingsbury Street Cafe a solid 3 if it wasn't for my last visit. 

If you are a party of 4 or less, then this place is great! The menu is varied, the ambiance/decor isn't overwhelming and the service is pretty on point. They make almost all of the baked goods in house, so you are pretty much guaranteed a fresh loaf of bread/muffin/scone/etc. The servings are a decent size and the prices aren't outrageous. 

If you are a party of 5 or more, go elsewhere! After coming here a few times (with 4 people or less), I thought it would be a great spot to go to with family. The location wasn't too far for any one person (and they offer valet at a discount) and the menu was sure to please everyone. After multiple texts, I calculated that there would be 18 of us (2 were toddlers) and called to make a reservation. They pointed out that making the reservation for Sunday Brunch for such a number required that everyone would be on time. I said that wouldn't be a problem and the reservation was set for 11 am. The day before, I received 2 phone calls to verify that I was keeping my reservation and that it would be for 18 people and that if we were 5 min late they would be giving away the table. I said, yes we would be there. 

So imagine my surprise when we all arrive (before 11 mind you) and they have tried to squeeze two high chairs and 16 adults at a table for 7. The restaurant wasn't packed and there wasn't even a wait, so how they couldn't prepare a table for 18 (after two calls, remember) is beyond me. The hostess said they were waiting for a few tables to finish up and then they would push them all together. About 15 min later we were all seated. Some had ordered drinks and they were slow to arrive (and we were later double charged and the waiter never bothered to correct the receipt after it was pointed out). The cafe decided that our poor waiter needed to handle a section of 4 other tables on top of our party which made service slow and inattentive.  We ordered and the food finally arrived and surprisingly only one order was wrong and only 4 plates were lukewarm. When we received the bill we tried to do all cash but came up short ($370 including an ""18% service tip"". We asked if would could split it and they said sure. I provided $310 cash, an additional $20 cash tip and a card. The waiter couldn't be bothered to count the cash, just pocketed it and charged the card the full amount. I couldn't believe it (it was my card) and asked for the charge to be cancelled, money counted (he wasn't worth the additional $20 tip but I know waiters are screwed paycheck wise and try to leave cash tips when possible) and the balance charged. No sorry's just ""oh that wasn't for me"". 

We asked if they had paper for our toddlers to color with and they provided dry erase boards, which were great because they loved coloring and then wiping them off. The kids silverware is plastic and bright colors - overall a great place to bring kids. 

So to wrap up - if you are looking for someplace to go with 4 people or less then Kingsbury Cafe is a solid option in a busy shopping area. If you are looking for a place with more than 4 people, I would pass."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Meag H.,Came to Kingsbury Street Cafe for a brunch meeting & was truly impressed!  Every bite was divine & service was excellent!  Would highly recommend this spot to anyone!
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Diana M.,"I am so happy to have stumbled upon this place! Geoffrey is the best host. Very happy with the service and the food. Had the Kingsbury eggs benedict which were amazing! I love trying out of the ordinary eggs benedict and not everyone can get it right. This for sure has been a delicious twist.  It is a short walk from the North/Clybourn red line stop, next door to the IO theater so be sure to stop by for a bite before the show."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Gino W.,"Second visit and it's rather clear that service and food are consistently good. I like that. I went for Sunday brunch, so that meant starting with a mimosa, at least. Good thing about the mimosa is that while you're aware that there is champagne in the cocktail, there isn't enough to leave you stumbling out the door if that's the first sip of something liquid for the day. The parfait of yogurt, granola, and mixed berries really hit the spot as introduction menu item. And the angel food French toast with orange slices and lemon zest was a different yet appetizing finale.

A friend had gone earlier in the day and said that the restaurant was not full. When I went a little later, it was filled but not the point where people were piled up at the door or waiting outside, which seems to be a popular thing at a lot of breakfast restaurants. Before Kingsbury Street Cafe ends up on a ""Best Brunch Spot in Chicago"" list and there is indeed a long wait, I'll be going back on a regular basis."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Ryan B.,"You can never go wrong with brunch at Kingsbury Cafe. It's always clean and inviting, the service is always excellent and even the most basic breakfast plate is wonderfully plated and tasty. I just love the turkey breakfast patties and herb potatoes! Check them out!"
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Emily H.,"Pretty good brunch place with lots of space and bright environment. The servers are very attentive and considerate.

The Vietnamese drip coffee is really good, the condensed milk makes it taste very good

The brunch items here are all very good, especially liked the crust of the quiche Loraine

They also have a bakery section for your to-go need."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Jonathan S.,"Came here for Sunday brunch. The place is very spacious so there's no concern about having to wait long to get in.I ordered the salmon hash which tasted great. The hash looks really healthy, full of different peppers and vegetables, but it packs a very tasty flavor. My only knock against the restaurant would be the lemon pancakes. I enjoyed them but my wife wasn't a big fan. She felt they were dry."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Bree L.,"Came in after a wine and whiskey fest and the service was fantadtic!!!  Quiet, clean and a great atmosphere."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Diana J.,"Nice open and airy space, clean, and very friendly service. They went out of their way to prepare for the two kids in our party, with special children utensils (plastic and colorful) and cups with lids for their water and apple juices. Those details were much appreciated!

We were a party of 6 for bunch on a Sunday morning and were excited to try this place from the glowing yelp reviews and delicious photos! However, the presentation and looks definitely trumped the taste of each dish. 3 of us got the Kingsbury Benedict (bbq chicken eggs benedict), and we all felt it was bland and unflavorful. The bbq sauce was on the sweeter side and the  benedict overall was bland. My friend got the special egg white frittata with smoked salmon and although the dish looked beautiful, it tasted just OK.

Perhaps the lemon pancakes or the deviled eggs were the way to go... but since everyone did mention the bbq chicken benedict, we were a bit disappointed. Probably a good place to go if you want to be healthy as they are definitely low sodium."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Victoria K.,"Great brunch spot in the area with a nice selection of alcoholic and nonalcoholic beverages to pick from, the menu has something for everyone from sweet to savory and original, the staff tries their best to accommodate their many tables, and we had a good time here!

We ordered the Build Your Own Omelette, Kingsbury Eggs Benedict, St. Momo and a House Bloody Mary!

The Omelette we ordered was light and fluffy with just egg whites like how we ordered it. The side of potatoes it came with was seasoned well, there was not a chunk of potato that was bland and undercooked. 

The Kingsbury Eggs Benedict featured BBQ pulled chicken which made the English muffin on the bottom very flavorful since it absorbed all of the juices as well as the perfectly runny yolk from the poached egg and the hollandaise sauce! 

The drinks were both very good. The St. Momo was very light and refreshing, perfect for the hot day it was. The House Bloody Mary had the perfect kick and was equally as refreshing."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Yvonne B.,"I don't know what it is about brunch but it seems as if many places don't take reservations. This first-come-first-serve thing that results in clusters of folks on sidewalks anxiously waiting to get eggs or pancakes has become an expected part of brunch culture. Or maybe it's the impromptu thing. Like, ""Let's meet for brunch when we roll out of bed"" making it kinda hard to plan ahead with a reservation.

Well. Kingsbury Street Cafe TAKES RESERVATIONS! And that's the first thing that I loved about them. On a Sunday there were clusters of people waiting out front and by the host stand and my party of four got to sail right past them and get seated. Score! It was such a cool, skip-the-line moment that we made reservations for Saturday brunch too. Saturday wasn't nearly so busy but I'd rather err on the side of caution.

Another thing that I like about Kingsbury Street Cafe is that I've been able to find free parking. Once was on the street and another time (I'm embarrassed to confess this) was across the street in the Whole Foods parking lot. (M wants me to interject that I did actually go to Whole Foods, bought a few things and then went onto brunch.)

Finally, the food. Let's discuss. One serious contention that we have with brunch is that many restaurants make stuff that we could make ourselves at home. Kingsbury Street Cafe has many, many menu selections that surpass our home-cooking skill levels (or at least our lackluster morning motivation to tackle the recipes). We've been pleased time and time again by generous portions of good food.

Let me tell you about their deviled eggs. They're a scrumptious bargain. I get them every time. Last time I ate them all by myself. I think there are five of them on the plate for $9. STEAL. Knife & Tine gives you one (like, half an egg) for $5. This sort of pricing is typical of Kingsbury Street Cafe. We think that they're very reasonable except for their coffee. Be careful to order the BOTTOMLESS COFFEE otherwise you'll get stuck paying for each cup.

I also recommend getting the maple glazed bacon for $3.50. Yusss. It's a perfect accompaniment for anything - even life. It could make a bad date worth the pain and suffering.

The other things that I've ordered (various alcoholic beverages, chia pudding and a Vietnamese salad) were all good. They hit the spot but didn't excite. It wasn't like, ""Oh. My. Gawd. This food is f**ing amazing and I can die right now."" But definitely solid dishes and good presentation.

My biggest complaint about Kingsbury Street Cafe is that it's noisy. It's hard to have a conversation. Saturday brunch wasn't very crowded and we all had to lean in on the table and raise our voices to be heard over the din."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Mark C.,"This is one of those places where ""I shoulda been came here by now "". Well today was the day that I made it happen. On the hunt for good pancakes, I was really hoping that Kingsbury would deliver the goods. And boom they did. I normally stick to my classic pancakes, no need for all the extra hoopla, just gimme syrup maybe some powdered sugar and strawberries and I'm Gold. Today I went ""adventurous "" and opted for the lemon pancakes. Best decision I've made on a Sunday . Life is about balance so if life is like these pancakes, nothing can go wrong. The pancakes themselves were damn near perfect. The lemon sauce on top was just amazing added bonus. 

I ordered a side of potatoes, well because it just felt weird to only scarf down some flapjacks. The potatoes, so good. I'm no potato connoisseur , let's simply say I'm part of the fan club. These potatoes are delicious. 

I'm a sucker for good service and Kingsbury is a winner all around. But you all know that already. Obviously I'm just late to the party"
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Stefanie M.,I love this place. Everything I order is delicious. The bartenders are very friendly and the wait staff is attentive (sometimes a bit more than needed). I usually come here and just grab a meal at the bar. But I've also ordered the shrimp frittata to go. Try the cheddar scone!!
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,C R.,"I enjoyed a delicious vegan scramble with sausage and toast. The tofu was well seasoned and veggies plentiful (maybe too many onions) and the toast vegan sausage were really yummy. 

Between the server and drink topper service is attentive and efficient. The server was particularly pleasant."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Ash W.,"Excellent spot for Brunch! The dining area is very bright and open and service was great. 

We split the french toast of the day (happened to be pear) and both thoroughly enjoyed it.  I got the avocado toast and was pleasantly surprised by the beautiful presentation and flavor.  He got the Piggy Moo Cluck sandwich and loved it (one of his faves). Overall it was a really enjoyable experience."
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Shannon T.,"When you walk in you pass their daily selection of pastries, which looked incredible and inspired me to order sweet over savory for brunch. My pancakes were thick and very filling. My friend ordered Kingsbury breakfast and highly recommends the turkey sausage. The cheddar scone was the perfect touch of savory with my meal. The only thing our table wasn't a big fan of were the potatoes. Our server was great and the menu had a variety of options. You can see the chefs cooking and know the food is fresh. I'd highly recommend this cafe!"
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Allison S.,Stumbled upon this nice breakfast spot while walking to Whole Foods. They accommodated a table of 6 for us instantly and had very attentive service. I enjoyed pancakes with fresh berries on top. The positions are huge so show up hungry and the coffee is strong!
kingsbury-street-cafe-chicago,Ritu R.,"Always love this place.  Fresh & clean ingredients.  Great drinks & fast service.  This trip we loved our chilequelles & veg hash (special) 

Always love their bakery offerings as well."
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Evan E.,"This place makes the best subs! The bread is everything and they have mastered the art. 

I cannot say enough good things about this GEM!"
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Amy H.,"Great sandwich, great prices, lovely Mom and pop shop. I enjoyed lunch here with my husband on one of the last warm days of the year so we got to sit outside on their patio. We both said we couldn't believe we hadn't tried it sooner and agreed that it was maybe even better than Bari. The balsamic vinaigrette is such a nice touch. Way to go Vinnie!"
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Krista S.,"Omg stop it! This place is too cute and so amazing!! Can we talk about the lady at the counter! Nicest lady ever!!!! She was so sweet, my first time here and right when I walked in she greeted me and told me all about the menu. I ordered the turkey sub with fresh mozzarella and pesto mayo. It was the special and it was everything and more that I was hoping for! What a great little Italian home grown place and I'm so happy I discovered it!"
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Patti L.,"I love the crunch of the bread!! The place is small. I went early and it was empty. Lunch is 1130 so it's best to go then. 
I like their sandwich over Bari. 
And the cost of a 9"" Italian is only 5.00. Can't beat the price for the taste. I wish they added a little more meat. It's only 1 slice of each meat for the Italian."
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Ameer S.,"Very rarely do I crave a sandwich, but last week that seemed to be the most appealing option on the block, and WOW I don't regret it at all. The manager was a very lovely woman who pleasantly walked me through their menu and gave me a great background of who they are. The Italian sub was delicious. I added olives to it, and it was superb. Totally will be back."
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Jennifer C.,Delicious fast fresh huge subs for $6 and they accept credit cards and have 15 mins pick up zone in front. The staff was friendly and quick and place was very clean. I went w recommend sub Italian so good and the bread had the perfect bite an chewy soft texture.
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Justin B.,"Ashamed that it took me this long to check out Vinnie's; I wish they had a couple of hot options on the menu and I wish they were closer to my house.  Otherwise, good times.

Tried the #1 and the Turkey Special; both were great, but the #1 is why I'll come back.  The hot giardiniera was the right call to add as well; very fresh ingredients and the bread was great.

Fair prices given what I am ordering here, fast service, and depending on your timing, free parking very close by."
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Davey B.,"Great, old-school, Italian sub-shop!!!  I cannot say enough good things about this place.  The cute and adorable decor,  the warm and friendly staff,  and the delicious subs make this place a West Town gem!  Every time I go into Vinnie's, I feel like I'm walking into a scene in Goodfellas.  

If you're looking for a cheap, delicious, and convenient deli or sandwich option, than look no further.  Vinnie's is a must."
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Mojo M.,"Still the best! Vinnie's sandwich-making ninjas, brothers Omar and Luis, produce standard and customized 9"" and 12"" subs in the blink of an eye. Dawn and Darlene greet customers with genuine enthusiasm. Get ready: Halloween's 'round the corner and Vinnie's regulars can't wait to see Darlene's decorations!"
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Michael P.,"Well, I thought at my age the last thing I'd have is shakiness about my faith & switch on over.   Sub sandwiches are what I'm talking about people, put down your pitchforks.   

Anyway, I called over to Vinnie's since I saw the awesome reviews around 9:15 & asked if I could get a sub delivered.   'No' (cue tears).   I was told they had an order for around 150 subs and wouldn't be opening until 11 (cue The Cure level of angst & sadness).   

But, she must have felt the pain over the phone, because she said if I came over right now, she'd make me one (cue Eye of the Tiger)!   

So after talking to her (with so many 'honey's' & 'sweetie's' I felt like I was talking to my grandmother (who was awesome, shut up), I hopped in my car & ran everyone off the road to get there (maybe).   

Damn.

Get your ass to Vinnie's & get yourself an awesome sub & some love (grandmotherly you perv)."
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Ferdinand S.,I was craving a good sub that would remind of me NJ/NY and this place came highly recommended on Yelp. The meats and garnishes were great but the bread was the only thing that kept me from giving it 4 or 5 stars. The bread on the east coast has a better crust and better in general.
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Kris K.,"Love Vinnies, wish they were open later and on Sunday's though... 

Really friendly staff, speedy and accurate sandwich makers, they always get the orders right and have quality ingredients!  Favorites are the Italian and roasted turkey. You must get the oil and seasonings on anything you order. 

Highly recommend!"
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Amanda F.,By far the best sub I ever tasted! I discovered this place thanks to some work colleagues of mine I thought their subs looked so good I just had to sneak a peak of where they got them. I'm so glad they left their subs in the fridge so I could find out where they got them from. After trying to figure out when I was going to get over there to taste a sub I finally got an opportunity to go during my lunch break today. I couldn't decide between the vinny and the Italian. I asked the lady at the counter and she recommended the vinny. So glad I went with her suggestion. The sun was so fresh and full of flavor. The sesame seed bun kind of scared me but it made the sandwich unique and added another layer of flavor. Will definitely recommend this place to my office for catered lunches.
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Kara H.,"At my job the owners buy lunch for everyone on birthdays. So someone suggested Vinnie's saying they had the BEST sandwiches. And OMG are the right. The freshest, crusty on the outside soft and chewy on the inside bread ever. My favorite is the turkey special but I sub the turkey for ham. You can't go wrong with anything that you order. 

A very sweet woman called us yesterday since we order quite a bit, to inform us of their St. Patrick's day special. Just placed my order for their corned beef special."
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Mark S.,This place is amazing! First time there today for lunch and was totally impressed. Super small place but I think that adds to the character of this neighborhood spot. Best tuna sub I've ever had.
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Rebecca R.,"Heading out on a road trip, I stopped to pick up an always delicious sandwich from Vinnie's. Though it is huge and at times a bit messy for the car, it is worth every satisfying bite. My partner and I typically order two and split them to enjoy two different flavours. We always get the special with chicken and pesto mayo along with a wild card decided on the fly. This time we got an Italian with hot jardini√®re. Success, as always. 

Be prepared for this huge sandwich and enjoy as soon as you can. the oil can sometimes get to the bread making it a bit less crunchy and delicious."
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Ashley M.,Wonderful service and an amazing sandwich. I went with the special of the day which was turkey with fresh mozzarella and pesto mayo. So good! Also loved that they had the entire interior covered in kitschy Halloween decorations for the season. Will definitely be back!
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Kamilah S.,"I drove 18 minutes one way to get the 12"" Italian Sub with hot peppers. The bread is so flaky and crunchy and moist and delicious, the vinegar and oil is to die for, the meat is so fresh, I will definitely be back."
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,S A.,"Even if the food was bad here, I would keep coming back. The service here will NOT be beat. Whenever you walk in the door, the owner lady greets you with a great big smile and asks a genuine ""how ya doin, hun?""

Speaking of the food, the simple, fresh ingredients result in some of the best subs in the city. You owe it to yourself to come by and check it out!"
vinnies-sub-shop-chicago,Rick A.,"Fantastic food!  I come here really often and consistently get excellent service.  I love that they always double check your order in detailed writing to ensure that you get the best tasting sub possible!!!  Not only is the main lady a sweetheart but her daughter/sister/cousing (I'm not sure if they are related)  is also super nice!

This is what hospitality is all about and they truly understand it!

Thanks Vinnies!

thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Padma A.,"Its on the lower level in Block37 with a good mix of Asian options....the service was slow but the food made up for it. We ordered the chicken panag, bento box and chicken padthai. you get 10% off with yelpcheckin which I forgot to use."
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Amy L.,"Omg I just want to thank you for the service , truly made my experience coming to Chicago ! The food is just amazing and on top of it they made off the menu dishes ! The food is so fresh and cold ! The sake maker was perfect ! I will be here every time I come here ! Thank you again !!!!"
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Marcia S.,"I'd been here several times, but only for cocktails and an appetizer. Finally had dinner here a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it. Would have given it five stars except for one mishap. 

We split two appetizers. The Mango Seared Scallops with avocado was a real winner, perfectly cooked and spiced. Wish they offered it as an entree.

The second appetizer was Lettuce Wraps. If a restaurant is going to prepare a traditional dish that is nothing like what diners expect, then it needs to warn them. Not sure what they were going for with this dish... a mixture of ground chicken, noodles and mystery ingredients that resulted in a cold, congealed glob set in lettuce cups. One bite and it was back to the kitchen. 
  
I had the Pad Thai with tofu entree, which was among the best I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot of it). Just enough ""hot"" to make it interesting. My friend devoured the Spicy Eggplant, which looked tasty but was so spicy I couldn't even sample a bite. 

We finished by sharing the Sticky Rice with lots of mango chunks. A little too sweet for me, but my friend loved it. When we got the bill, they had credited us for the lettuce wraps (the server apologized at least three times). And they had comped the sticky rice, which was a surprise. This is what customer satisfaction is all about.  

Thalia Spice is on a side street off Chicago Avenue. Seemed to be plenty of street parking. There's a small, inviting patio we'll try next time."
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Ramiro R.,"The food was amazing and the service was excellent! Chad was so nice and very helpful with this being my first time here, couldn't have asked for a better experience."
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Jessie Elizabeth J.,"Went in on a Friday after work and the place is empty. 

Two servers are talking, the male server is loudly lecturing the woman server about why women cheat and how women take advantage of men by always being paid for. Coincidentally I was meeting my BF there to treat him to dinner. 

Male server eventually came over and I asked for a drink. It was unsettling how he went from his sexist rant not 20 feet away to giving me a big fake smile and described my habanero cider to me like I had just ordered an expensive wine. Felt really forced and over the top. 

Atmosphere is dreary. It's dark inside, there are two silent big screen monitors playing cable shows including commercials, and no music. 

BF shows up and remarks on how empty the place is. Despite the awful atmosphere I insist we stay for one or two plates. I really wanted the food to make it worthwhile. It did not.

The menu is massive. You have sushi bowls, sushi burritos, thai bowls, maki rolls, noodles salads, ect. If a restaurant claims it can make all of the above then fantastic. If not, maybe less would be more.

We ordered the jalapeno poppers for $8 as an appetizer. This was 4 jalapeno halves filled with half cream cheese and half spicy raw fish lightly fried and decorated with sweet sauces. The halves were large and the pepper itself was not spicy, and the spicy fish was lukewarm and underwhelming. No distinct flavor and very meh especially for $2 a piece. 

Just want to note one of the specialty rolls comes covered in melted mozzarella which reminded me of the sushi pizza episode of Kitchen Nightmares. What is that even doing here?

We decide to try the Sunset which is raw tuna over crab rolls with cucumber, avocado, and sauces. The fish to rice ratio is as others have said not good. There was barely if any cucumber or avocado.The rolls were filled generously with a very sweet crab salad but the rice was SALTY. I mean way too salty. Also the ginger and wasabi were low quality-ginger is white but soaked in sweet preservative and horseradish wasabi was jewel osco quality. 

BF stopped halfway and because i'm stubborn I made myself eat the last pieces. Stomach ache ensued and not from overeating. The bill came to $30 before I realized the roll was overcharged a buck. This was fixed promptly and I paid to $29 bill. It was a waste.

Butterfly Sushi is phenomenal and right down the street. Always good service, food, and bustling crowd."
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Soumya S.,Food is amazing every time I come here. Nice calm elegant ambience. Our server Chad was amazing! Made our night.
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Jeffrey L.,"I was here about 4-5 weeks ago and the experience wasn't too great. The menu was totally changed but I was expecting the maki & sushi!

So here I am today, heard they brought back the sushi. The menu looked great as well as the pricing, now questioning about the quality.

Wrong. Everything we tried were way better than I was expected. Not only the food portion was more than enough for the group, the food quality was way over-qualified.

I'm a huge fan of maki and they have the beef ramen that can go with them!

Definitely coming back for my other occasions."
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Magda M.,"Found a hair in my salad.  Very disappointing.  

The staff was not really friendly and the chef could not accommodate my order.  

I Was excited to find a place close to my apartment that I can walk to.   But this is not a place I would go back to."
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Jenn H.,"Newly reopened with an ""Asian fusion"" theme, I would say the new version is a little strange. Thalia's is located in my neighborhood, so I was very hopeful that it would be a hit, but I can't say that I loved it. 

On the menu, you'll find everything from sushi to bulgogi fried rice to cream pasta. It's a lot to digest, literally and figuratively. It seems like Korean is their specialty, so I wish they'd focus on that cuisine and drop all the other stuff. 

When I went, we had the bulgogi fried rice, two sushi rolls, onion rings, kimchi fries. The food was decent, don't get me wrong. In fact, I really enjoyed the bulgogi fried rice as it was quite flavorful and we actually ended up ordering a second bowl. However, it's the concept that I just can't quite get on board with. I find myself missing the old Thalia's which focused on Thai food. You could walk in, order some pad thai, and you knew what you were going to get. For some reason, this fusion just doesn't quite work for me.

Also, the vibe inside feels like it's trying to be a hip and trendy restaurant downtown. There are lights like you would find in a club, and the music is LOUD. I just don't see this ambiance working in the quiet River West neighborhood."
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Gino W.,"A few years ago when I went to Thalia Spice, the experience was not bad, but it felt like there were kinks that required sorting. I guess those got taken care of because the food as of late is a hit.

Clay pot mussels remind me of Thai tom kha. Instead of chicken, this comes with meaty mussels. Yes! I ordered mango seared scallops that were very tender. The melange of mango, avocado, and tomatoes made this addictive. Yes! The Thai fried chicken wings were better than wings I've had at restaurants that brag about their fried chicken. The Malaysian roti canai could be a little spicier; I'll order it spicier the next time. The dessert of fried banana with vanilla ice cream drizzled with honey was a delectable finale.

The service seems consistently top. I ordered my dishes so that there was staggering between each coming to the table. There was no rush from the server, so I got to enjoy the courses, or appetizers since I ordered a round of appetizers only.

Whatever change went into place between 2013 and now was a good one."
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Anne W.,"This place is basically a trainwreck.

I've never been here before but apparently they now have a new owner and they completely changed the menu. I didn't even really mind the change in the menu since I was never there before. The food was a complete meh. Nothing special. Nothing to write home about.

But the ways in which this place went wrong? Let's count the ways.

First of all, I walked in and was ignored by everyone. I finally just had to ask if I could sit at a table myself or else I probably would've stood there forever.

After we ordered our food we waited and waited and waited. The place was not busy at all. When our food finally did arrive it was cold.

They seemed to be filming something? I'm not sure. But it was completely unprofessional and at one point I was in the shot and nobody ever said anything to us at all. Nobody asked us if it was okay for us to be filmed. Nobody informed us that they were going to be filming. It was a terribly uncomfortable experience for me to be eating and worrying that I was being filmed.

Towards the end when we tried to get our check there was NOBODY. The woman behind the counter was on her cell phone and ignoring everyone.

When it was finally time to pay the bill, they got the ENTIRE STAFF, including the front and back of house staff to gather for some sort of photo??? We were ignored as we walked out. We probably could have walked out without paying and nobody would have noticed.

This whole place was terrible. I don't know what was happening with the filming but it was so unprofessional for them to do filming and not let anyone know what was going on. I couldn't believe that they were open as they completely STOPPED working to take photos and record some sort of video. I am never ever coming back here again."
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Christy W.,The ratio of rice to sushi is really poor. I've seen better rolled sushi at the grocery store. Really disappointed. I had to pick rice off the pieces so I could taste something other than rice. I loaded a photo.
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Hyunjae K.,"Excellent sushi with new and inventive rolls, great service and decor with very reasonable prices. 

Great for a group of friends! Excellent sushi!"
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Ann R.,"One of the BEST Thai places in chicago.  Honesty I was expecting something mediocre or too expensive. I was so wrong! I was blown away at how fast and fresh the food came out.  The pad Thai is one of the best I've had, ever!  The place is very comfortable and not pretentious.   Nicole gives amazing service and recommendations.  This mezcal mule was one of the best drinks I've had all summer."
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Safia Z.,"DO NOT GET WAITED ON BY MARK! He's an awful waiter and has no idea what he's doing.  It's no wonder why the place was empty on a Friday evening.  I wasn't able to talk to a manager (on a Friday night?! Wtf). Mark messed up our bill 3 times, made our table wait for over an hour and a half to bring food for 6 people, another hour to fix our check and the food wasn't even that good.  He charged us for 3 items we didn't order, never came back to check on us and would tell people to 'hold on' and just chat with his buddy up front.  TERRIBLE service and establishment.  It's under new management- go figure."
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Ruth M.,"New menu, new restaurant  and I finally decided to give sushi a try. Ate the Salomon Obsession and the California crunch. Definitely will get more next time."
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Meelee A.,"Great sushi selections with affordable price, service is top notch and the atmosphere is great for date night, or family dinner! We really enjoyed Thalia under new management!"
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,Jeff H.,"I had a $50 gift card and the new management would not honor it after being a loyal customer for 5+ years.

Not going to be coming back."
thalia-sushi-bistro-and-lounge-chicago,James L.,I have been craving for the spicy salmon burrito I had last week from Thalia... Since my route was around the area... I had to stop in again and try that delicious burrito again... It was another five star for me... I also tried the sashimi combo which wasn't in the menu yet... but it was soooo fresh and delicious... I'm writing the review again because I forgot to take the picures last time...
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Jessica J.,"The food at this place is out of this world! It's the kind of place I could literally order 5 meals at once! The prices are incredibly reasonable for the quality. I had the nachos and the breakfast potatoes, and HOLY HELL they were amazing! They have the super melty vegan cheese that dreams are made of! 

The employees are extremely kind. I am so happy I found out about this place!

Protip: try going there when it isn't the lunch rush. The seating is super limited. Hopefully, they do so well they can expand soon. :)"
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Maleesa X.,"You've lost me, Upton's.

Probably the worst service. Be prepared to wait, wait for a long time. I was in yesterday to order my usual: 4 Mac, 1 Kale Salad and waited for over 25 minutes. Why did that take so long, you ask? Maybe because my food was already done and sitting by the register with my name on the receipt, yet all the cooks were too busy checking their phones. I actually went to the register (and waited there) to ask about my order when I saw that my order was already boxed...waiting to be bagged for who knows how long. I actually had to flag a line cook to bag it for me.

Here's what you'll notice waiting for your food to ""heat up"" - (everything is already cooked) every single person working needs to read the printed tickets every few seconds....as if the order has changed prior to the 3 seconds before. They read the ticket, say it's ""mac and cheese"". They scoop the mac and cheese out of the big container, heat on the grill, look at the ticket, check their phones, look at the ticket, check their phones and then pack the mac and cheese. After that's done, the look at the ticket again, make the next thing because after reading the ticket for the 10th time, they remember they still have to make another item because god knows why...!!!

Also, just saying - when you have an open kitchen, we see everything. Put your phones down! Is that even sanitary?!?!"
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Kay X.,"Food Poisoning Alert!!!

Fudge, here comes a clich√© - I wanted to love this place and the gentleman who helped me was super nice (he gets 5 stars). 

Upton's Breakroom was hella hard to find (there is no store awning); this place definitely needs some signage, I drove around the block once and only found it when I creeped really slow up Grand. The space is very small (only 8 seats) but it smelled so good when I walked in.

I hadn't eaten all day and wanted something light since I had dinner plans later that evening; seemingly those were cancelled. Fried Bacon Mac was my selection that includes their house made seitan along with a Harney & Sons 100% organic apple juice.  There were no napkins out and the food container was handed to me with other cheese & debris on it - they could've at least wiped it off; I had to use napkins from my car. The macaroni was creamy and super salty yet I didn't really catch any real cheese flavor.

Fast forward 30 minutes - I was very nauseous and initially thought it was because I'd had so little sleep. I went home and laid down. When I awoke two hours later, I was greeted with violent food poisoning that went on until at least 2 am the next morning and fading illness as I write this review now. I've never been sick like that. When I left, I was already thinking of nachos for my next visit. Either cross contamination/unclean hands or working surfaces/production issues but needless to say I will not be returning to Upton's."
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Eric P.,"Quick and dirty:

Food: The fried mac and bacon was amazing. I would even a whole plate of that with a side of the kale. As it is I got it with the Bar-B-Que Jackfruit Sandwich. I should have known better to get that. I don't particularly like their jackfruit offerings. The BBQ sauce is just not that good. This is something people fight over, so YMMV, but if I could try the same jackfruit slow-cooked for hours with KC Masterpiece, I'd try again. As it is, I will never eat that product here or from the grocery store again. Also, too much damn cabbage on that sandwich. The kale was just good. It's kale. You know what you're getting. Glad I had it to help add value to my fried mac and bacon!

Service: Friendly, quick, helpful, informative. I like the counter-style approach for this sort of menu.

Facilities: Decent layout with tables as far from the door as possible. Restroom was decent. Reasonably clean and spacious. There was a tube coming in from outside the bathroom that drains water from someplace else in the building, maybe somewhere where they make the seitan products.

Overall, I'd like to find a new sandwich to try again next time I'm in town (maybe the Bacon Ranch Cheeseburger, as I do like their bacon), but beware the Bar-B-Que Jackfruit Sandwich."
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Cassandra B.,"The fried bacon mac is out of this world. It was amazing. I also had the employee meal, a buffalo chicken salad, which was kind of boring. I had the gingerbread monsoon and while the big chunks of cookie were awesome, the shake started to separate after about 10 minutes so it was really watery."
uptons-breakroom-chicago,David C.,"Recently; I decided to take a lunch at this place.  I'd read so many great reviews about their FrIed Mac n Cheese.. I've been a vegan for 3 years so I CRAVED Mac n Cheese.  Omg !!! It taste so goood. Makes a fat man happy. I'm not fat but I'm happy.  Along with the Mac n Cheese; I tried the Bacon Ranch Cheeseburger. The Seitan taste fresh and tender.  
The staffs are great and personable. The atmosphere simple. White walls and three tables. It's a vegan diner with 80s vibe. You have the options to eat inside or outside. There's eating area right in front.  

I would recommend this place."
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Roseann M.,"Thanks to the Visiting Vegan of Pittsburgh, who chose Upton's for lunch, I finally made the trek to West Town and wondered, afterwards, why I hadn't gone there on my own. Upton's Breakroom was wonderful.

The restaurant is small. You stand at a counter to order your food, give your name with your payment, and your order is brought out to you. There is probably only enough seating for 10 people. Upton's seems to do a steady carry-out business at lunchtime, so minimal seating wasn't a problem while we were eating.

The Visiting Vegan chose the Banh Mi sandwich. This consists of baked tofu and bacon seitan and veggies on a roll. Because the V.V. is also keeping to an Ayurvedic diet, she asked that the jalapenos and radish that typically comes on this sandwich be deleted. She loved her food. It really is a big sandwich. She took half of it with her.

I was really tempted just to order a few sides off the menu, because I wanted to try various items and they all sounded so good. In the end, I got the Bar-B-Q plate. This consisted of a jackfruit barbeque sandwich with a side of kale and the fried bacon mac. This was the first time I ever had jackfruit, and I liked the sandwich very much. I'm always trying to recapture the flavor of barbeque I had as a child, when I ate all sorts of dead things. I would never get a barbeque from Dairy Queen now, but I do have a taste memory that I want to match. This barbeque sandwich came very close. I would definitely order it again.

A confession here -- I really have not had much kale in my life, and have never really wanted to add it to my diet, despite all the press about how it's a nutritional superpower. Well, if all kale tasted as good as the steamed kale I got at Upton's, I would eat it every day. It's that good. 

Upton's sells various meat substitutes in grocery stores around Chicago, and apparently is very successful with that. However, I think they'd break all sales records if they could package the Fried Bacon Mac. Oh boy is that good. The V.V. ordered a side of it, and she loved it too. I would drive to West Town again just for the Fried Bacon Mac. 

All in all, a terrific introduction to Upton's. I would go again in a heartbeat. If Upton's was closer to where I live, I'd be a regular."
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Reanna K.,One of the first vegan restaurants I tried when I moved to Chicago and it still stands as some of the best vegan food I've ever had. The bacon mac was amazing and the breakfast sandwich was LIFE CHANGING. I love this place and can't wait to have it again next time I'm back in Chicago!
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Alissa O.,"Few gluten-free options, all vegan.

Non-gf dishes may be made gf by removing ingredients.

I used a GlutnGo pill for this meal so that I could check out their claim to fame: seitan.

The breakfast sandwich featured grilled tofu and seitan bacon with hollandaise sauce. I thought the sauce lacked character, but the tofu was good and the seitan bacon added enough salt to give the sandwich at least some flavor. Not the best English muffin I've ever had, but also not the worst.

The bacon ranch cheese burger was awesome! I absolutely loved the fresh dill flavor in the ranch and how it complimented the pickle. I don't know what they use to make their patty, but it's burgerlicious.

The loaded potatoes were a great side. I really got to taste the bacon seitan topping. The cheese sauce definitely tastes like nutritional yeast, which I like, but it could use a bit more of a nutty component to diversify its cheesiness.

Next time I'll try something with their famous jackfruit. Oh yes, there will be a next time."
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Jevita N.,1 word... amazing. A friend and I split the tacos and Italian beef with Brussels sprouts and Mac and cheese for sides. It was so good. They also gave us a sample of the soft serve ice cream. So worth the drive.
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Kim Z.,"Upton's has the best bacon Mac n Cheese I've ever had, vegan or not. However, the fact that it's vegan is a huge bonus since I'm a newbie 2 monther vegan. I still crave the flave of bacon and cheese! Holy cow, this stuff is like crack. 
 
I ordered delivery from work at Randolph and Ada, and the food was here within 30 minutes of my ordering and paying. And my delivery driver was cute. 

That was so satisfying, I'll be ordering and dining there in the future."
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Talibah M.,"The decor really makes you feel like you're at the gig on your lunch break. There was no food made like this in my job's cafeteria though. I had some tasty Korean tacos. I prefer corn tortillas but these were fine on flour ones. My sister got the nachos. The presentation was awesome and the bite I had was delicious. I will definitely be back to try the vegan Bacon Ranch Cheeseburger. The cookies are large, taste good and full of good stuff like sunflower seeds and ground flax. But at $3 I probably wouldn't get another one. Happy to have another option for vegan food. And its great to see how I can use their products at home."
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Jessie Elizabeth J.,"A+ vegan fare coming from an omnivore!

Staff are very friendly and anticipate your needs before you ask. 

The bbq platter came with perfectly cooked greens, tangy sweet pickle slices, the phenomenal bacon mac n cheese which is creamy and savory...

The bbq sandwich itself is made from jackfruit which mimics the texture of pulled pork but is best enjoyed not trying to compare. The sauce is VERY tangy/vinegary which I enjoyed but some may need to cut with additional sauce. 

The seating area inside is cozy and they have outdoor seating. They have a platter of the day deal which changes so there is always a new option."
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Kaitlin N.,"As a self-proclaimed extreme carnivore, I absolutely loved this establishment! I tried their jackfruit BBQ sandwich and bacon mac and loved them both. The sandwich will definitely give you the meaty-ness you need if you're used to BBQ pork/ chicken sandwiches!"
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Robin M.,"Super friendly staff and DELICIOUS food. The loaded potatoes were as good, if not better, than any non-vegan version I've ever had. I had the combo plate with waffles, scrambled tofu, potatoes, and bacon seitan, and not only was it super yummy, but at $10 it was a great deal for all of the food that I received. 

My boyfriend and I went when they opened on a Sunday (11 am) and though there isn't a lot of seating, we found seats just fine, and the tables did not fill up until around noon. They do have take-out available, too. I'm really excited to go back and try all of the other food!"
uptons-breakroom-chicago,G A.,"I have only tried their ""bacon"" burger, mac n cheese, and the nachos. 
The nachos are my favorite, and I crave them all the time!! I've had high expectations for nachos ever since I've had these. :)"
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Scott D.,"As a fan of their packaged products, I was eager to check this place out. With seating for 8, it's pretty small, but they do offer take-out, which seems to be the majority of their business. 

The food is reasonably priced and tastes very good. I had the Korean tacos, the Brussels sprouts and the mac & cheese. Everything was delicious. Brussels sprouts are one of my favorite vegetables when they're cooked properly (read: not boiled) and these were cooked perfectly with a nice tangy sauce. The mac & cheese was rich and warm and completely comforting on this brisk Chicago day. The tacos were on point with their flavor profile and the slice of avocado on each balanced out the mouthfeel. 

Next time I visit, I would probably get take-out but it's a cute enough place with a large mural of their logo and friendly employees eager to take your order. Definitely worth checking out even if you're not vegan."
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Maxwell F.,Food was pretty good especially the bacon ranch cheeseburger and those nachos where unreal. The location is very small
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Rosa J.,"""Hey guys...I'm clocking out for my break...be back...whenever I'm done eating!""  

""Upton's Breakroom"" is part of Upton Natural Seitan Meat Factory.  It feels like an employee breakroom, except that it serves some of most amazing vegan food in the city.  

I get asked a lot about vegetarian or vegan diet.  I haven't yet gone 100% vegetarian, but I'm not a huge meat lover and am always craving for fresh veggies and fruit.  Hubby and I came here on a Saturday afternoon.  Menu isn't listed on the wall anywhere, so make sure that you grab one of the paper menus by the register.  

Hubby ordered one of the Chicago-style Italian ""Seitan"" beef sandwiches.  Seitan is also known as wheat meat.  It's high in protein and can be made with a wide variety of flavor profiles.  Nevertheless, do NOT assume that the sandwich tastes just like a regular Italian beef sandwich.  The Seitan in this sandwich was very lean but reasoned well.  I would say give it a try, whether you're a vegetarian/vegan or not.  

On the other, I LOVED the togarashi bowl, featuring grilled kale (delicious), baked tofu, carrots, pickled radish, shredded seaweed, sesame seeds, and purple rice.  The lemon tahini miso dressing was a great touch to elevate this bowl of goodness to the next level.  This dish energized me and was just what the doctor ordered for a veggie lover like myself.  

By the way, they have vegan soft serve.  I know lots of people who are lactose intolerant and can't enjoy a cone of ice cream like an average dude and dudette.  Don't you feel that you're slightly ""judged"" by your peers when you can't take in certain things or have chosen a specific diet for any type of reason?  I DO!  

If you dine in there, you can peek through the kitchen and watch employees cook every meal made-to-order.  One of the young ladies made herself an ""employee special"" plate for herself before going on her break.  Ummm...are you hiring?  My first job in college was food service.  Sorry if I don't have enough credentials in this field, but I surely would like to work for food.  

We will be back here definitely.  The location is the northeast corner of Hoyne and Grand.  Thus it's accessible via CTA #65 (Grand) bus."
uptons-breakroom-chicago,Sheila N.,"I wish we had one here in Minnesota. My husband and I saw this little spot and specifically wanted to come here to try their vegan food. Everything we had was delicious! It's a small little place. It's located in the building where they manufacture their products. There's a small sitting area outside and I think a small seating area inside. 

We had the Bahn Mi tofu sandwhich, rib sandwich with mac n cheese, korean tacos, the combo plate, and ice creams. OMG everything was so good. I can't wait to go back and have some more soft serve."
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Jayme H.,"Up until recently (I moved out of state) I've been a regular at Lovely's for close to 3 years. Despite the change in ownership and whatnot, I always knew I would get good coffee and a tasty treat whenever I stopped in (which was 1-2 times a week). The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming. Its very spacious and there's usually a mix of young professionals and families cooped up inside. 

My go-to is a soy latte and recently they even had lavender, which is my all time favorite flavor to add to a latte. This literally made my dreams come true. They also have great croissants and bagels for an easy breakfast. 

If you're in the area and need a cozy corner to work in, read a good book, etc. you can't go wrong with Lovely's."
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Mike O.,"Bad for groups and meetings.  I run a Meetup and we've met here many times before.  Typically our group has a meeting of 8-10 people, but the topic we had one time recently drew in about 20 people.  To make a long story short the person in charge was very unhappy about the presence of our group, even though everyone had made purchases of food and, or drinks.  Most of the clientele here are people quietly camped out studying for the day and I think our group might have contrasted a bit too much with that vibe because we were having an audible discussion.  The management tried to dissuade us by repeatedly cranking the overhead music so that it made it difficult to hear each other.  Then the manager asked one of our members to ""bring who's in charge"" when she went up to buy something.  She admonished me for taking up two tables for two hours without renting the entire venue.  She then told me to tell my members to buy some more food ""tell them to buy another cookie or something"".  She continued to harangue me until I promised her several times that we'd never come back.  In fact, she would not let up until I finally promised her that neither I nor anyone in my group would ever come back, even individually, even though I live on Milwaukee ave. I think she thought that our group was ""gaming the system"" by only buying food and drinks and not renting out the venue. 

One little nit-picking thing is that their brownies and bars are all packaged in plastic, which is fine, because it keeps them from getting dried out, but they hand it to you like that, even when you're eating in.  Here is a crazy idea: open up the bag with the scissors and plate it for the customer."
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Dorothy S.,"Super cute cafe, the space is really open and decorated with a vintage chic vibe. The girls behind the counter were friendly and helpful. I tried their strata of the day, it was delicious, the salad it came with was also yummy. I also got an almond croissant that I thoroughly enjoyed. So every cafe I go to, I always get a chai latte. It was the only thing I did not love at Lovely, didn't hate it, but didn't love it either. I sat there for a couple hours enjoying my food and reading a book, it was a lovely way to spend my Saturday morning. Good spot to study or hang out. There's pay for parking right outside, I got there around 930 on a Saturday morning and easily found parking, but noticed that parking wasn't so ample when I left the cafe a couple hours later."
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Jessica H.,"Lovely Kitchen & Cafe is a great coffee and/or breakfast/lunch spot. Great coffee, food, & atmosphere. There is plenty of space for working/studying or hanging out. The patio in the summer is amazing! The staff is also very personable and fun to talk with!"
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Quin T.,"While waiting for an appt nearby, I stopped in for a coffee and was not expecting such fantastic and friendly service from the staff. Not that I expected the worse, but my interaction with Caitlyn was the best that I can ever recall from a coffee shop. She was very respectful, so nice, and I appreciated her honesty when I inquired about certain items. I ended up getting the gingerbread rooibos caramel tea latte and it was good, however it was just lukewarm and I am sure if I had said something to Maggie she would have corrected it as she was equally just as nice. The chocolate chip cookies are a must!!! These have now become one of my favorite cookies and I am very thankful I do not live in the area, or I would have to stop by on a weekly basis just for the cookies."
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Dustin B.,Local feel with vintage furniture but coffee taste was sub par. Bottomless coffee deal was a good idea.
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Mimi S.,Maybe it was a bad time of the day but they had 4 bakery items to choose from; their chocolate chip cookies were great! It's an amazing place for people to sit and work...lots of tables and has an airy feel to it.
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Sofia S.,"Very hipster.  I was getting  a costume fitted in a neighborhood nearby and had some time to kill, so I stopped in here. I was hoping for some quiche, but they were out.  Staff recommended another dish on the menu, which I tried and was not terribly undelighted with.  I enjoyed the ambiance of the place; it reminded me of an old tyme general store.  There is plenty of cutesy brik-a-brak covering the walls for your eyes to feast on.  The prices were ok; I felt it was a little on the expensive side for what you're getting, but the food was quality and I was able to charge my phone in peace, so in that regard, I felt it was worth it.  Not sure I will ever make this my regular hangout a la ""Central Perk"" but it was a delightful spot to sit and recharge on a sunny afternoon."
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Dan H.,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this little gemstone! It looks like an old pharmacy inside but it's a bakery and creative breakfast nook with an extraordinary outside seating area.

Mary is the owner/operator and she was delightfully pleasant as she obliged my request for a recommendation and served me a vanilla latte and poppy bun. 

I love this place."
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Kathleen M.,"I ordered coffee and a sandwich. After waiting 20 minutes for the sandwich I finally went up to the counter and asked if I could get the sandwich ""to go"" instead because of the wait. The woman at the counter asked ""what did you get?"" I told her and then the four employees that had been standing around for 20 minutes talking, rushed into the kitchen to start making my sandwich. They told me it wasn't even made and asked me what side and everything I wanted with it, which was never asked of me either. 

I really wanted to like this place, the atmosphere, coffee and employees were nice but I was more irritated that I had just been forgotten about. I might try to go back and try it again."
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Molly S.,"Since coming into new management, I'm sad to say that Lovely seems to have lost some of its loveliness. The food is inconsistent (giant sandwich one day, same sandwich is 1/3 of the size the next day), the place looks sort of barren and out of sorts (what's going on with the table arrangement and that beautiful, but empty, bake case?), the AC is rarely turned up enough to cut through the heat of sticky summer days, and some of the staff are downright grumpy (although most of the people there are pleasant).

I was so in love when I first started going to Lovely. I'm really sad it seems to have lost a lot of the charm and service I used to encourage people to experience. I hope this is just a rough patch while new systems are getting set up and new-ish people are settling in."
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Asenath N.,"Awesome caf√©!
Came here with a friend for a possible wedding venue.
My friend and I both thought the place was great! It will be nice  for her intimate wedding. The place is very cute and we love the decor.
The owner was super sweet  and very helpful going through the process with us."
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,JD M.,"Amazing service 

Great, great coffee, sweet atmosphere, very cozy for a quick bite, or a whole day of studying ( though not sure they have AC, so beware on super hot days)

Breakfast sandwiches are the best I have had in Wicker, and I love Breakfast! 

Definitely recommend them to any and all!"
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Priyanka D.,"Woke up one morning craving a flaky, scrumptious, filling croissant breakfast sandwich and that's exactly what I got here. 

It's so spacious and the seating ample. There's even a patio! 

Wifi was fast and the service very friendly. Great place to read/work/eat/relax."
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Cynthia L.,"Cute and tasty shop - ice coffee is a little light for my taste but still fresh and good!  Lovely closes relatively early (but average for a coffee shop) so this isn't really a spot for you to squat and pump out those work emails or finish classwork.

I had an ice coffee and an apple crumb muffin.  The muffin was so good - sweet but not overly sweet.  The apples inside the muffin taste like dried apple slices.  I think that was my favorite part about this muffin - so unique!  They also have sandwiches - breakfast and lunch, hot and cold - but I didn't come with the intention of having a meal just a light snack.

Overall really cute place. Would recommend to anyone!"
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Viktorya T.,"Cozy place for studying (internet, outlets, low music volume). Staff was super friendly and kind. I ordered a turkey pesto and a bran muffin. Although the muffin was on the dry side, I hope to try some of their other pastries during my next visit."
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Kari F.,"If I gave this place any less rating, I'd be a nut. I'm in Lovely regularly - sometimes every day of the week, sometimes all day as it becomes my office... seriously, I might as well sleep there. I work from home virtually as a consultant, so when we moved into the area 3+ years ago, I was beyond thrilled to have Lovely around the corner. This coffee shop/sandwich shop/bakery is a very relaxing atmosphere with fairly low (not annoying) music most of the time, unless it happens to be a busy/talkative day. They have free, reliable Wifi, which is key for me, but I always ensure I'm paying my way by getting lots of food, coffee, or tea throughout the day. It would be nice to see more power strips to connect at the tables that don't have them close by - but this is only an issue on busy days, since I can find a place to plug in most of the time.

The staff is super chill and friendly. The food is great - delicious and plentiful breakfast and lunch options, plus some other sweeter, baked goods. I have tried and liked just about everything (except the sandwich with the garlic spread, not the best). My favorites are the quiche (types varies every day, which is cool), the breakfast sandwiches (all varieties), the turkey pesto sandwich (awesome), Lovely tuna, and the new caprese sandwich. The only thing I wish so hard for is organic greens with that insanely delicious homemade dressing. I love that they have so many organic tea options. They will give you a cute glass teapot, not just a single cup, which fills several cups of tea - awesome.

When the original owners decided to sell, I was so nervous I would lose my favorite place to go for work or any break away from the house! But when I saw that beautiful sign on the window that it was going to be under new ownership of their long-standing manager, I was ecstatic. My favorite part of this was that the new owner added some new sandwiches and sides. I have also noticed everything produce (avocados, bananas, etc.) look fresher too. I felt the need to review because this place has been so good to me. Love ya, Lovely!"
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Jackson K.,Great outdoor patio space.  Perfect for grabbing an easy cafe style lunch.  Food was excellent.  I had the Turkey Club.  It was delicious.
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Wednesday Q.,"Cute and cozy. Tons of space, free WiFi and available outlets. Had a delicious spinach and bacon salad."
lovely-kitchen-and-cafe-chicago,Jennifer N.,"We live right near Lovely Too (in Edgewater) and were pleased to check out the original.  Lovely is as wonderful as our local branch - with the best cookies in town (especially that peanut butter chocolate chip) and lots of great soup options for lunch.  This Lovely is way more decorated and aesthetically oriented than our local one which feels a bit austere. Apparently, the spot has a new owner so it will be interesting to see what changes, and what stays the same. Stay tuned."
mart-anthonys-chicago,Donavan B.,"OUTSTANDING.  I took out of town clients here and recommend for anyone visiting.
Calamari and egg plant very well cooked.  Pleasantly greeted by owner which gave the warm feel of a true independent.

Will be back."
mart-anthonys-chicago,Brian D.,"A Chicago classic run by the same family since 1981. Old school, corner restaurant serving Southern Italian with beautiful wood features and really tasty and authentic food. Specials every day, and classic music in the background. Took my mother in law who is 100% Italian and she loved it."
mart-anthonys-chicago,West L.,"My review went from 1 star to 5 Star, and that is the difference between the takeout / phone experience, and the dining in restaurant. Love the authentic, old school atmosphere. The food is great, classic Italian. And the customer service is great in person. One time we booked a party of 10 marathon weekend. Opentable had the wrong phone number so the restaurant was unable to confirm the large party. We showed up and was informed the reservation was cancelled, but the the owner went out of his way to get us a table."
mart-anthonys-chicago,Meaghan M.,"Oh my gosh! I LOVE this place!!!! Came here for Valentines Day and thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it. First off, the location is adorable. Cozy, romantic Italian restaurant sitting on the corner across from a train going by totally gave me New York vibes. I can't wait to come back in the summer and enjoy their patio. :) Now inside, loved the huge fully stocked bar with tvs- and friendly staff. The old school family Italian photos on the wall is such a great touch. The baked clams were phenomenal. Chicken saltimbocca was excellent- highly recommend. Next time Id love to try their grilled calamari- check them out you will NOT be disappointed!"
mart-anthonys-chicago,Erin S.,"My husband had the veal Parm and he loved it. I had the whitefish and was mostly happy. Got a few ""fishy"" bites, but overall it was good. Fun atmosphere- very authentic feel and menu"
mart-anthonys-chicago,Viv A.,Fantastic family owed Italian. The Dad passed about a year ago. Very sad. But his son is keeping it up with the same quality. Delicious food and great service. And the prices are a bit less than most. I've never had the pizza because everything else is so great. One day I'll have to break down on order one to take home after work.
mart-anthonys-chicago,John Z.,Went here after picking my wife and sis up from a show downtown. Reminded me of places where I grew up on the west side and Cicero. Had the Veal Parm. Was probably the best I've ever had. Wait staff and management were welcoming and attentive. Wish I knew about this place before I retired from the Police Department. Would have been one our dinner spots.
mart-anthonys-chicago,John L.,"I'm continuing my tour of neighborhood Chicago Italian restaurants, with Mart Anthony's today in West Town after Caf√© Bionda yesterday in the South Loop (Old Capone territory). Took out some people from the firm including a new girl from Brooklyn. This place is kinda out of the way on a quiet street, but it may be different in summer with more of a crowd. Smallish place inside, but classic classy Italian with a long wooden bar next to a bunch of tables. Goodfella's type of place. Not crowded today, but this is January in the beginning of the new year. I have heard of this place for a number of years now, and we thought we would give it a shot. GREAT PLACE. Had my usual linguini and white clam sauce which I always get to break in a new place. FANTASTIC with a ton of clams, but not in the shell like Caf√© Bionda. Apps were sausage and peppers which were delicious and calamari (OK). When I go back I will try the grilled calamari, like they serve at Erie Caf√© (saved for another review). The new girl at the firm had the eggplant parm which was better than good. Very reasonably priced wine by the bottle (so we got 2), and the service was right on the whole time. This is a great place to bring clients, go with friends, to go with the wife, or to bring the secretaries for lunch or whatever. Casual, classy and fun. Like I said, little out of the way and prob have to get a Huber as there aren't many cabs to flag down. Owner was there-nice guy-and made sure we got taken care of. I didn't see the clams and linguini on the menu, and they may have whipped them up for me. We had a great time with great food. So many other great things to try here, so I'm absolutely going back. I would rate this place the equal of any of the many similar Italian restaurants in my old South Philly hood, or Jersey and NYC spots that I loved. This is a go."
mart-anthonys-chicago,Tim V.,"Old school Chicago Italian restaurant with fine food and a cozy neighborhood atmosphere. Everything we had was quite good. I really liked the veal parm which was well prepared and generous. The portion could feed two. The service was especially friendly. It's getting harder to find these authentic family restaurants, so I'm really happy to give them our business."
mart-anthonys-chicago,Audrey M.,"We went to Mart Anthony's for my friends birthday dinner on Sunday 12/17 and it was amazing! When we got there, we were the only guests and they told us we could pick our seating which was great! The waiter and staff was so nice and very attentive. The food was great and the drinks were even better! A young kid from the neighborhood came in and delivered a Christmas card to the staff with his family and it was the cutest thing ever! I am so glad we came here to celebrate with great atmosphere and conversations! I will be back as soon as i can! Thank you Mart Anthony's for a wonderful experience!"
mart-anthonys-chicago,Colleen D.,"I just love this place. Been coming since it was on Randolph. The mood is laid back but very friendly and the food is just amazing. The servers are always so nice - they don't hover but they are around when you need them. We tried the veal with eggplant / red sauce - so good. But I think the better choice was the sausage, onion, pasta....we also ordered meatball on the side.
Since I wrote this review we went back and tried home made gnocchi with arrabiata sauce - I have gone back so many times to pick this up for home that I think the valet driver recognizes me - ;)"
mart-anthonys-chicago,Sophia S.,"Mart Anthony's is a delicious, authentic Italian restaurant! The meat ravioli was fantastic, and their margaritas are amazing! 
We sat on the patio, across from some cool street art and in view of the Willis Tower. The service was good, and I will definitely return to try some more dishes!"
mart-anthonys-chicago,Daisy K.,"We went to this restaurant last week and the food is DELICIOUS! People are nice and are making sure that everything is going great. 
I took the chicken lemon and that was amazing.
I will come back for sure! 
Great food/great people
Didn't try the desert but I will next time!"
mart-anthonys-chicago,Scott r.,"Great family-owned locals Italian. I personally liked the special calamari, but feelings were mixed around our table over this non-traditional preparation. That said, we all enjoyed our pastas. Owner made us feel like we were regulars-and we will be!"
mart-anthonys-chicago,Giovanni B.,"I was last here three years ago prior to today's annual Marty Fest. The food as I remembered it was fantastic. I was fortunate enough to relive that memory during my dinner tonight. I had ordered the Chicken Lemon (Leh-moan), which consisted of two pieces of chicken smothered in a lemon wine sauce accompanied with a small bowl of rigatoni pasta. My oh my was it heavenly. Due to the amount of people that were in attendance for the festival, the service was much slower and poor unfortunately, but I understood the circumstances. The prices are a bit higher than most Italian restaurants (my entree was $17) but the quality is outstanding. Conveniently located on the quiet street of Hubbard, I would recommend sitting out on the patio for lunch, or even dinner. Highly recommend."
mart-anthonys-chicago,Jess V.,"I love the gnocchi here. It's pillowy perfection and when I pair it with the vodka sauce it's the best comfort food out there. Once I veered into the salmon territory and while it was okay, it was nowhere near as delightful as the gnocchi. I haven't strayed from that first love and never will again."
mart-anthonys-chicago,Alane M.,"Best eggplant ever 
All our dinners were delicious 
Lasagna white beans and sausage we were all happy and fat!"
mart-anthonys-chicago,Lizzy N.,"We came here with a groupon - it's in a cute part of the west loop that I had not been to before. The inside of the restaurant was completely empty at 7pm but there were a few other diners at outside tables. Throughout the meal, the service was slow. Waters were not refilled, the server was slow to bring the check, and to even take our orders.

The wine was okay - they didn't bring a bucket to keep the white wine cold, even though it was pretty hot out and I had to ask for one. We started with the antipasto salad which was fairly classic but just okay. I had the black linguine with shrimp and scallops and found it to lack flavor and salt. Such a bummer because I love squid ink pasta, but this was just one note and tasted like typically pasta. 

All in all, we probably won't be back because there is so much amazing Italian in Chicago."
mart-anthonys-chicago,Laura L.,"Best 3 hour lunch ever. I Could have stayed all night 
Thank you to all of the amazing people that run this little gem. It's a real family business. Food was good wine was great atmosphere was awesome and the staff was incredibly accommodating. Can't wait for round 2"
mart-anthonys-chicago,Scott C.,Chicken parmigiana is great. I fly in to Chicago and my first stop is Mart Anthony. I love the food and bring my friends when they come with me on business.
twisted-spoke-chicago,Randa U.,"Great restaurant for hangovers and brunch. They make their own corned beef hash and give you a generous portion. My group wanted to come here for the bloody Mary's and they came with pepperoncini and salami. I don't like BM but the group loved them. 

They didn't have too many non-pork options, which sucked but I am glad i found something and it tasted great. I want to come back for dinner!"
twisted-spoke-chicago,Christian L.,"I have been coming here with my biker friends for a while now but this time enjoyed it even more with my daughter and 2 very good friends.
Brunch selection is great! Bloody Mary's are on point but the service has always been Ehhh...
(Could be better)"
twisted-spoke-chicago,Nick B.,"Great selection of beers and pretty good service.

The downside was the obviously drunk patron who was too loud and trying far too hard to impress his date. 

We'll be back.  Hopefully he won't be."
twisted-spoke-chicago,Otto V.,"This is the father of all bars, and a drinkers paradise. With 20 tap craft beers to choose from, if this is your choice of drink, it's easy to find one you like; but it is the whiskey drinkers who get a pick of Heaven: With hundreds to choose from, I defy a person to tell me¬† that they didn't find a bourbon they liked here.¬† 

Twisted Spoke also ages some bourbon. Those wood barrels on the bar are not just for show. They contain the good stuff getting better.

The decor is simple and unapologetic; with a semi circular bar that seats 24, and a few tables by the windows.
But is the back wall of the bar that's captivating; with waist to ceiling rows of bottles neatly displayed.

The food deserves it's own review. Good comfort food featuring about a dozen sandwiches, gumbo, chicken, pulled pork, burgers and tacos, served in portions to satisfy the best appetites. 
The food is so good that anyone who goes for lunch the first time, may be pressed to think this is a good restaurant with a great bar. Or is it a great bar with good food? 

Twisted Spoke has a room in the back of the bar for those who prefer a quiet setting, and a roof deck for the al fresco crowd, but to get the full experience of the place, everyone should sit at the bar, at least once. And attempt to count the bottles of bourbon on the wall. 

Go for the bourbon, stay for the food. And the drinks."
twisted-spoke-chicago,Jane V.,"We have been wanting to go here for a while, but, after reading some of the reviews on here we were a little leery about coming here.

We were pleasantly surprised.  The food was good, and the bar has one of the best selections of liquor in the city.

We went on a Tuesday not realizing that they have $3 Tuesdays where they have a nice selection of beers for only $3.

We had the shrimp po boy sandwich and it was just as good as others that I have had in the City of New Orleans.

We also had the gumbo which was actually very good, very tasty and filling. We will be back here on a cold day to have more gumbo.

They have a very long bar with tables close to the window. But, if you go through the host stand, there is a room in the back with tables for people who want to sit in a quiet place and enjoy."
twisted-spoke-chicago,Steve B.,"After Lincoln Park Zoo Lights, the kids needed to eat. Naturally, my friend suggests Twisted Spoke. Counterintuitive? Yes, awesome? Another Yes. 

Mary Poppins was on the TV, and when Boxing came on the staff was kind enough to leave Mary Poppins on. Menu is standard and solid pub food. Strong Beer list and on Wednesday - half priced whiskey (don't bring the kids on Wed). 

This information came by way of the gracious and hospitable Nikki. She was great. She got the children squared away. Knowledgeable and attentive - she's a Rock Star. All in all I would go back and expect to enjoy myself, and I would request Nikki."
twisted-spoke-chicago,Sam T.,Had a great time at brunch last weekend on Sunday around noon. There were 4 of us and we were seated right away. The service was quick and super friendly. We got the cheese curds to share and they were delicious! I had the breakfast sandwich and it was pretty big. The gumbo was great too; just a little spicy. They were even nice enough to give us some fruit as our sides instead of fries since we just came from working out. Would definitely go back!
twisted-spoke-chicago,Kathy P.,"Fun place. Great bloody Mary's and beer selection. Just missed brunch. Came in before a Blackhawks game. My husband got the classic road rash mary and loved it. I tried hopewell fun punch apricot/mango sour. Yum. I ordered an egg sandwich which was good. My husband got the burger. He didn't love the onion rings. Waiter , santos, was really nice. Got the Firestone Bretta Weiss on tap which turned out to be 13 dollars- pricey and draft prices r not on menu. Cool place. Will be back."
twisted-spoke-chicago,Blake L.,"Twisted Spoke delivers a bountiful of bar bites, Po Boys and Booze before Bulls & Blackhawks games. Twisted Spoke defines a neighborhood gem that so many locals, Bikers, and United Center goers have enjoyed for decades. Offering an open atmosphere to all diners, this restaurant and bar is your perfect option for breakfast, brunch, happy hour, dinner or a bite and drink before a game at the UC. I only heard good things about Twisted Spoke and was eagerly looking forward to eventually trying the Food! 

This past weekend, after basically walking around the whole city, my fianc√©e and I decided it was a great time to go to Twisted Spoke as the sun was shining and we could sit on the rooftop. Brilliant idea as we got to enjoy some sunshine paired with a delicious meal. I will admit it, that I am a chicken wing connoisseur! If the wings look decent on Yelp, I am likely ordering them. Given I knew I was going with the Shrimp Po Boy, I was questioning if the 12-piece wing would be too much Food. Concurring food expectations is no problem for me and I said bring it on! Thus, I ordered the buffalo wings with the Shrimp Po Boy which also comes with fries. Get the ventilator ready as my meal was fully fried and I nearly took down both plates of food. This meal definitely left me happy and in a food coma. I definitely gave myself a pat on my back and was saying way to go Blake.. paired with my meal I ordered a cold draft beer that hit the spot on this warm and humid summer day. My fianc√©e went with the Ahi Tuna salad which she has enjoyed before and enjoyed again. 

I would definitely go back to Twisted Spoke to enjoy and try more southern delicacies that I could enjoy before a Bulls/Blackhawks game."
twisted-spoke-chicago,Lou P.,Was way better in past. Had not been back for a few years. Used to have great beer list. Used to have great food. Now? Same menu but not so good in terms of quality of food and service. Added an extra star because in the summer it's a nice rooftop.
twisted-spoke-chicago,Linda C.,"I loved this place for brunch! I had steak and eggs which included a delicious salsa sauce and toast with amazing blackberry jam. I loved every part of it and even though I was full halfway through I just had to finish it. My only complaint though is that I ordered my steak medium rare and it came back medium well, but it was still tasty. I definitely recommend coming here!"
twisted-spoke-chicago,J G.,"Miss this place a ton. Loved my favorite bartenders, and when I lived there, I'd go out of my way for the best. Low key environment, cool interior. But I loved the food. Great burgers. Good chicken. Decent wings.  Would travel to eat here. Just not 500 miles. Wished they had a location in our town."
twisted-spoke-chicago,Chris S.,"I wanted to come to this place for a long time. I almost moved not too far from there and my friends go in there for their Bloody's all the time. I'm glad I did. The place is unassuming and has a fun menu. The bartenders do not take themselves too seriously and that attitude comes through for the whole experience. I had a few ""safe"" beers until Jeremia (sp) made it his mission to have me try something different and provided plenty of samplers before I settled on something I have not tried before. He really made the experience excellent for me and my girlfriend. While I stepped in to grab ""one"", we ended up having such a good time we stayed for 3 or 4, and may have snuck in a few shots. Was told that Wednesday is a great day to stop by for their Whiskey special and when I come back I'd like to try some of their food. Both of us will definitely be back. 

Cheers"
twisted-spoke-chicago,Whitney P.,"food was great, menu was entertaining to read and drink selections were unbelievable.  For a small place the layout is executed perfectly to where no matter how busy you still feel you have your own room.  We have been back a couple times already :-)"
twisted-spoke-chicago,Mysel O.,Full bar so the drinks were poured heavy and the po'boys are delicious. Great service and they have a rooftop. I live this place it's right in the neighborhood although parking is a little scarce. Good drinks and eats!
twisted-spoke-chicago,Lauren K.,"I may not be the hard-ass Harley Fatboy biker chick like I've often dreamt of being, but I have an appreciation for bikes, booze, boobs and bloody good food so I'm pretty sure that I'm qualified to say that the Twisted Spoke is the shit.  I have been trying to get in here for a while now and finally I was able to scratch the itch.  I'm sure that The Twisted Spoke would have been crazy good no matter when I'd eaten here, but it tasted especially good after pulling an overnight shift.  Just as The Twisted Spoke seems to be the cure for hangovers, it's also a cure for fatigue.

I perked up so much once I sunk my teeth into those cheese curds, and I continued to perk up as I ate more and more of their food.  Everything that my fianc√© and I ate while draping our tired selves over the bar was amazing!  We shared the cheese curds, followed then by banana fritters and the breakfast burrito, but my eyes were being drawn to so many other items too!  I could barely decide.  Anyways, the cheese curds were perfect - the batter wasn't too thick and the cheese melted as it should.  The fritters were out-of-this-world!    They were like pancakes, but with the density of flan...weird, but awesome!  And the burrito, as simple as it may sound, was great and it came with fresh fruit!  

Now I'm not the biggest fan of bloody mary's, but I had heard from my fianc√© that these were some pretty rockin' ones.  I took a leap of faith and ordered the Great Lakes Tattooed Mary (???) Aka the one with pineapple and pork butt garnishing it (completed by a sidekick of lite beer); I actually did like this bloody mary, but I'd probably stick with my beer next time...real biker chicks drink beer anyway...I may has fit the part if I want to be one someday.  

My fianc√© got the envied Zombie Dust which he enjoyed as always.  They don't only have the precious Three Floyds on tap, but there's a huge selection of other draft beers on tap...and good draft beers at that.  While we're on the topic of alcohol, you gotta go here if you're any type of whiskey or scotch lover.  I mean, c'mon, they have got the hook up.  It's one of the of the biggest whiskey bars in Chicago and accordingly, it will make your eyes dazzle in complete envy.  It's kind of expensive for one glass of scotch, and perhaps a little more affordable to get the bourbon.  Still, you can come here and get your pick of liquors...aka, it's paradise.

My fianc√© had arrived soon after they'd opened on a Saturday morning and it was perfectly quiet, though it became more crowded as our time there progressed.  It's an easy place to relax, especially after midnight ON Saturdays as I hear they play porn on tv's at that time.  Some people may say ""gross"" but I say ""why not?  Bring on the boobs!"".  I will have to make it here on a Saturday night..like I said, bikers, boobs, booze and bloody good food all the way."
twisted-spoke-chicago,Brian B.,"Went here for brunch today and had a great experience. Food was awesome. My fried egg sandwich was the bomb. It was filled with bacon, and the bread was super soft. My girlfriend's po-boy was probably the best she's had in Chicago. The Bloody Mary's were very good too. I liked the Deliverance, made with scotch and also filled with bacon, more than the Bloody Maria. Service was ok, but the prices were very reasonable, so we'll definitely back be back."
twisted-spoke-chicago,Mia D.,"Loved this place! Went with friends before a hockey game. Close parking, fun atmosphere and good food! Will definitely be back!"
twisted-spoke-chicago,Jessie Elizabeth J.,wanted to update that the jalapeno poppers are now actually imposter poppers which consist of spray cheese mixed with flecks of jalapeno fried in the SHAPE of a jalapeno half but not containing any I could taste or find. Sticking to just drinks from now on.
twisted-spoke-chicago,Tony P.,"Don't be intimidated by the motorcycle on the roof with a skeleton sitting on the seat and numerous wheels sitting in the window wells.  We dropped in for a couple of drinks while we were waiting for dinner down the street.  They were very nice and have any mixed drink or liquor you may desire.  Our group had a varying requirement from Beer, wine, vodka to mixed drinks.  They had a very large selection of craft beers on tap, many selections of Vodka and a small selection of wine.

They were so nice and on the spot to help keep us hydrated.  One of our groups wanted a Margarita and they actually asked if they could serve them last so that they could make a fresh batch of sour mix.  They not only mixed some nice drinks, the presentation of the margarita and mules were very nice.  I judge a bar based on their vodka and wine selection.  I can't say they have a great wine selection but they impressed me that they had Deep Eddy Vodka.

We did not stay for food but they had an interesting list of specials and would like to come back another time to try their food.  This is a great friendly place for fun.  It is loud but it is a very nice bar.  Again don't let the look from the outside intimidate you, every time I place the Twisted Spoke it is very busy and there is a reason, it is fun friendly, vibrant and hip."
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Gino W.,"On Grand Avenue in Noble Square isb what appears to be a relatively new sushi and bento restaurant. Nice and spacious on the inside, it has the potential to become one of Chicago's noteworthy Japanese restaurants.

Went with a friend and had tamago miso soup, salmon salad, yakisoba, beef udon, salmon nigiri, crab nigiri, and shrimp nigiri. All of it was fresh and full of flavor.

Service scores high marks but the food scores points through the roof. It's sweet finding a unassuming restaurant that puts the usual list of Top What-What to shame."
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Stephanie L.,"This place is legit at 3.5...

Short summary
The food was all pretty good.
The food was all pretty over priced.

It just felt like a very average sushi/Thai restaurant."
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Jazz S.,"I'll start off by saying, for all these reviews that say this place is inexpensive or reasonably priced, I want to know exactly where you all are getting your money (lottery? inheritance? shady side jobs??) That being said, if you think of it as 3 dollar-sign ($$$) outing instead of everyday casual food it is DEFS worth it for the food.

The restaurant was empty at 6 on a Monday evening, had a cute ambiance. We got the seared tuna tataki to start which was delicious and soooo tender and one of the best I've ever had. Can't comment on the sushi since the one roll we had wasn't that good but it seemed like just a bad roll.

Tsukiji is worth the trip for just the ramen! Got the tonkatsu for $16 and $2 for extra  egg and it was delicious, big enough to share and probably in the top 3 for me in the city. I know it's not fish but still!"
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,William Y.,"Fish was fresh, and ramen was flavorful. We went on a cold winter day for lunch and we were the only table there. Service was nice. Fish selection is a bit limited but everything we got was good."
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Charlene L.,"I'm really shocked how highly rated this place was! Prior to coming here, I did my research and took a look at the menu. I was super excited that they had quite the variety when it came to the sushi items plus the variation in cooked foods as well! For the price, the quality and even the service overall, I'm just shocked how highly this place was reviewed!

Let's start with the basics.. the raw stuff! I wanted to get a feel for the quality of fish so I stuck to items such as seared Ahi tuna and chirashi bowl. Although the cuts of fish are pretty thick and hearty there it's seem to be a previously frozen flavor to it and pungent fishy taste with each bite. Nothing screamed fresh at all.. 

The roll we decided to try had an equal portion of fish to rice ratio which was good. But again, that fish quality... something about it. 

As for the udon we ordered, I've never tasted something quite like this! It definitely had an atypical thick broth with a fishy taste to it even though it's supposed to be beef flavored. Overly  salted, and not a typical udon at all, this is a dish that if you're looking for that traditional light and soothing broth you should probably not order it here. 

One ahi tuna appetizer, a chirashi bowl, one roll, and an udon later, we were looking at a price tag $90 and feeling unsatisfied. I don't know about you, but I don't like the feeling of leaving a place with empty pockets and an unhappy belly. Unless this place changes for the better, I most likely will never come back again."
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Kelly G.,"Wow - I've been to most places in the area including butterfly (which is great) but this place is awesome. We ordered the ocean roll, rainbow roll, crazy roll, seaweed salad and miso soup. All were amazing, the rolls tasted fresh, the fish was cold and the rice was warm so we know it was fresh. The ocean rolls was the best by far. We will definitely come back. Also service was really nice and friendly!"
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Lisa H.,"this place is only 3 years old.  you would never know it from the way that the storefront looks.  it is like a japanese restaurant in tokyo.  

super friendly & attentive service, i never felt weird being alone in an empty place (i went at an off time).  i got the tsukiji salad, which was really nice with a wasabi dressing, oranges & seaweed (although overdressed, i used the dressing to dip my maki roll in-great dressing) and a spicy fried shrimp roll which was outstanding.  i could have eaten much much more.

i'll save my appetite for the next time.  i'll be back very soon because the menu is huge & there's a lot i would love to try.

nice work :-)"
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Mary Z.,"This was such a cute little Japanese place. I loved the cleanliness of the location. Its very hip, modern and clean. And the food was delectable!

A friend and I had:

Miso Soup
*Seared Tataki Beef
*Oyster Shooters
Sashimi: Hotate Aburi, Ama Ebi, and Salmon Volcano Aburi
*Ommera Sushi and
*Apple Port Sunrise Sushi

Now, to get into detail on some... 

*Seared Tataki Beef was not the most tender I've experienced. It was certainly chewy. Tried one piece and then another to give it a chance but the next was also chewy, very much like chewing gum so I let my friend eat that. I couldn't swallow, it was that bad. My friend agreed. Maybe it was just a bad batch.

*Oyster Shooters were just ask requested: Spicy. We got two big oysters per shot glass. They were big but good enough to swallow.

*Ommera sushi roll was amazing! Perfectly crunchy and packed. My fave part, besides the miso soup.

*Apple Port Sunrise sushi roll blew my mind! Or my mouth! I have never tasted a sushi roll with apple and this was a great first experience. This is one I would recommend to everyone that visits. Caramel sauce on top.

$120 later, we left satisfied and full!"
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Alisa G.,"Was craving sushi and saw pretty good reviews for this place so we decided to stop in. I ordered a rainbow roll and a crunchy spicy tuna roll. Overall, the fish tasted fresh and it was good~ good portions. It was nothing to rave about but it was definitely tasty. If you're looking for a quick bite of sushi in the area, this would be a great place to stop by!"
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Aditi M.,"I came here for ramen, not sushi, so my review will mostly be pertaining to that. 

After having heard of this place that serves ""legendary"" ramen, my roommate and I came here for a late Friday night dinner. The ambiance and space were surprisingly pleasant. Parking was not. 

I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen and my roommate had the Kira Miso Ramen. Much better than Ramen San, in my opinion, and more authentic than High Five Ramen. I added an egg to mine and it was perfection. We also had the mango mochi for dessert. The presentation was noteworthy, and the mochi was pretty standard. 

Note that this place is BYOB! They also serve alcohol, and there's a $5 corkage fee."
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Lorelei S.,"So when I saw the name of this sushi place, I was like, ""wow, they must have HUGE balls to name themselves after Tsukiji! Hopefully the fish is super fresh...""

I mean, it wasn't awful, but it wasn't spectacular or worthy of its name by any means. Bland sushi rice had no vinegar. Spicy crunchy roll was alright, I guess.

But the real reason that I have to rate them pretty low is because our delivery order took over 90 minutes to arrive. It was snowing, yada yada, so normally I would just give them a pass... but we ordered delivery from 3 other places at the same time (don't judge!), and they all came within an hour. Tsukiji took WAY longer. Plus, the sushi was lackluster. So I think you could do way better than this place if you're looking for sushi delivery."
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Anne-Michele D.,This is my favorite sushi restaurant in Chicago. The sushi is always fresh. I was so happy when I found out they were opening a 2nd location in the Merchandise Mart where I work. My favorites are the Island Roll (I have them add cream cheese) and the scallop roll which I get mild. I bring my family here as well and they all have loved everything they eat. I also recommend the oyster shooters in season.
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Ziyuan C.,"We had high expectations for this restaurant but the food here was not as good as they advertised. 
We ordered Oyster shooters, agedashi tofu, katsudon, and hibachi with chicken. The hibachi had no flavor. All the other food we ordered also tasted below average. 
Our bill was $80. We think with this quality, this place is overpriced."
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Lawrence M.,"Great eats! 
Loved the Beef Curry and Takoyaki.
Very fast and very reasonable.....My go to Japanese delivery!"
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Jasmine L.,"Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday tonight. We ordered the squid salad,  ramen and some sushi rolls. Everything was great, and we were happy with the service. Will definitely recommend this place!"
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Eddie C.,"Overall: Tsujiki fish market is an ok place to dine for it's lower prices but the warm is uncomfortably warm and the sushi tasted like it was frozen

Food: Salmon Donburi... the salmon tasted frozen. The quantity is pretty good. The miso soup was good

You know that uncomfortable feeling when you sit on a warm toilet seat? That's what it felt like when I walked into the Tsujiki Fish Market restaurant in Chicago. I saw sushi lying there that seemed to be unrefrigerated and wondered how it could have been fresh. 

The waitress was nice and attentive but the food wasn't great. The salmon in the salmon donburi had a weird chewiness to it that made it taste old. I'm guessing it had been frozen for a while. The miso soup and free edamame were solid as well as my girlfriend's eel dish, but my dish was disappointing."
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Michael B.,"I lived in Japan for a while, it was some time ago so I forgot why I seldom eat Japanese food, ( though I like it) and,  why the Japanese rates of gastric (stomach) cancer per capita are highest in the world - salt/sodium!

It's a charming restaurant with lovely, friendly service. I ordered the spicy miso ramen, my bad, as I normally don't eat a lot of salt in my diet.  Maybe it was me that wasn't used to a lot of salt but I found my ramen too salty for my pallet. 

Everything else,  the sushi,  yakatori etc were fine."
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Sally L.,"I ordered take out twice and dined-in once at this place. I really enjoyed some of the items on their menu, like the dynamite and the sushi entree. I had a good experience with the food when did take-out. When I dined-in, I had an overall negative experience. First, I circled around the area for 10 minutes looking for parking. Second, the wait staff was not very attentive even though we were the ONLY people in the restaurant & our bill was wrong. 

The food was all right, nothing out of the ordinary. I do like the spicy tuna roll, it tasted fresh and had a nice spicy kick. I felt the appetizer items are bit too pricey, we ended running a $50 bill for two people.

Ambiance is really nice inside, they have a large menu .. so I wonder why this place is empty every time I visit."
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Becca P.,"A true hidden gem on Grand--fresh fish, tasty rolls, great service and BYOB, what else could you want?! 

I've been here a number of times and am always happy to have it as part of my evening! Absolutely love it here and definitely recommend it to anyone looking for good sushi in the area! 

FYI-it's not ""true"" BYOB, there's a corkage fee ($5/bottle or 6-pack)"
tsukiji-fish-market-chicago-5,Avanti B.,"Really great sashimi and a large menu for non-sushi eaters (gasp)!  BYO, although I can't remember if there's a corkage fee at all.  Very small if there is one.  I wouldn't say it's inexpensive, but it is worth every penny.  Excellent service as well, and a really nice restaurant/feels classy."
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Nicola P.,"Love Love Love!!

Ordered takeout and it was Perfect! The pizzas were so flavorful and so fresh!! The Cobb salad was big enough to share and had ALL the right ingredients! 
I'm picky with my avocado and this avocado was Spot On!!!! 
Tyler ordered the pepperoni pizza and it was light and delightful, crunchy, thin, and ....Delicious!
I ordered the Hawaiian with black olives {the key to my heart} and they used BBQ sauce!!! I Loved Every Bite!!! 

-the pizzas & Salad were Huge!! So worth the price!!!!!"
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Henry M.,"My wife and I were on a serious hunt for NY style pizza and came across this pizzeria. The pizza is great but they lost us as future customers. Why? Customer Service. Without it, I don't care how good your food is. 

Here's my reason: We ordered delivery one week after our first successful experience/delivery...1 hr later, we receive a call notifying us our order had been cancelled bc they didn't have drivers. Thanks for the heads up sooner? I wasn't happy but accepted it. One week later I  attempted again, giving them another shot. This time, I called to make sure they had drivers and could deliver...they said yes.....1 hr 23 min later, I get a phone call saying they couldn't deliver bc their driver won't deliver to our location...yet they delivered 3 weeks prior? I don't expect handouts but if you fail a customer twice I would have expected an effort to keep that client, not just a ""sorry""."
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Christopher M.,"22"" pizza? 

Thought I ordered a 22"" pizza. I paid for a 22"" pizza. Looks like I got ripped off."
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Jenn H.,"Love this pizza! Paula & Monica's has become a regular for us when we order pizza for delivery. Full disclosre, I've never actually been to the restaurant itself, so I can't speak to their customer service or the dine-in experience, but I can 100% vouch for the quality of their pizza. It's delicious!

We typically order the pan pizza. The crust is buttery, light and amazing. It sort of reminds me of the pan crust at Pizza Hut but less greasy. I've also ordered the thin crust, and while it's decent, it does not compare to the pan crust. (I would probably order thin crust elsewhere if I was craving a good thin crust slice.)

Rest assured, if you are looking for a pizza to complete your cozy night in, order the pan pizza here! It's so good."
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Kunal O.,"This pizza is the perfect pizza to enjoy at home on a cozy night in with a bottle of wine!  The pizza comes on a very thin crust dough that strikes the right balance of flavor without being overlooked! We ordered two different pizzas: the margherita pizza and the vegetarian pizza.  The margherita pizza is a unique twist on an old classic, a white sauce pizza with basil and feta cheese. Very flavorful! The the red sauce on the vegetarian pizza was out of this world!! The toppings were not so abundant that it over powered the sauce or crust. I highly recommend this place to everyone, i would argue that this is one of the best local pizzas I have tried in Chicago!  I have also read that they make a pan crust pizza that we are sure to try on our next visit!"
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Jay F.,"This is delicious 'za, one would say. I'm in a love affair with pizza. Always have been, always will be no matter what! I enjoy all types of pizza pies. With that being said when co worker wanted to enjoy some pizza, of course I joined the fun with her. 

The first time I enjoyed was about a month ago, I ordered personal pan with pineapple and jalape√±o. HEAVEN ON MY TONGUE. Yuuuumm...The ingredients definitely had a fresh taste. The crust was good! I ate all my crust which is a big deal because I'm a crust snob. Overall This pizza got a 5 out of 5, no complaints!

The second time was today. The team decided we all wanted pizza again yay. Someone suggested chicken & jalape√±o, I said hmmm...I usually hate chicken on pizza but it might be good w/ the jalape√±os. Then I saw the option for "" hot pepper"" and decided on that. This pizza would up being thin crust, and I was pleasantly surprised!!! Whatever is better than heaven on your tongue, their thin crust is that. Especially when hot!!!! This pizza got a 6 out of 5. And yes, like the other tips/reviews have said it is definitely a New York slice style! 

I'm gunna go out on a limb and say it's my new favorite pizza place. Definitely worth a try."
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Emily W.,I really enjoyed their pizza here! The cheese pizza is a must try ! Nestor the manager gave me great service
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Aumi Lee F.,This review is long overdue. I have been coming here for years and i just cannot understand how i have not expressed that this is some of the best pizza in chicago and most definetely in the area. They have the most delicious and underrated sauce. It really makes this pizza special. The cheese is always so fresh and their pizza fresh out the oven is SOOO DELICIOUS. i would recommend ordering a pizza fresh out the oven as they do sell slices but are not always Just out the oven. I have not yet had any of their other dishes but that is only because i have never wanted anything else cause the pizza is far from dissapointing. As much as i love ordering whole pizzas from this place i often get a jumbo slice because its all the deliciousness of their pizza in a small portion with a drink for 6 bucks. You literally cant beat that
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,B S.,"My new favorite in the area...Very nice people, really tasty dough, fresh toppings, price is right. Why did it take me 10 years to find this place???"
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Natalie V.,"We are devout followers of Pat's Pizza (South Loop) and Salerno's (Grand Ave), so for us to order from a place no one has yet recommended and that we simply found on Yelp, was a milestone. Surprisingly we were tired of ordering from the 2 above places and I jumped on Yelp to see who delivered to our area. I came across Paula & Monica's, saw the reviews, and took a chance. We were pleasantly surprised at how good this pizza was. I am not a sausage fan but the sausage was light and I was able to chew it without feeling like I was biting into fat. Cheese was perfect. Crust was a little too light for me (I'm a crispy person) but it all meshed well together. We were surprised the biggest size was a 14"" and so we ordered 2 pizzas for 6 people (2 of them being strong manly men).  I wish they would've had a 16"" option for us American and Chicagoans who like to EAT.  But all in all, extremely happy with our pizza and am adding it to our pizza delivery options for the future."
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,marc r.,"It's a great place for an area littered with great pizza joints.

Try it out for sure."
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Lola Z.,"Living just a block away, I come here all the time. I was immediately surprised by how amazing the pizza is. Thin crust, always perfectly cooked, and just delicious. I have never had any sort of complaint about the pizza. The jumbo slice is an amazing deal & comes with a soda. That's my go-to. 

The only reason I didn't do 5 stars is because their sandwiches need some work. I love the Chicken Italian sandwich, but if you don't eat it right away, it gets very, very soggy. Their cold sandwiches leave something to be desired. They're just a little bland for the price. I was disappointed when I got the Veggie sandwich. If they up'd their sandwich game just a bit, this place would be absolutely perfect!"
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Kristin C.,"I am pretty much obsessed with pizza. I don't know how New York-ish I found Paula and Monica's to be but it is GOOD. And they don't cut it in party slices, damn it (hooray)!

I have ordered from here a few times, most recently last weekend. Delivery was great and taste was spot on when it came to the half sausage half roni thin crust. The only thing was the largest size is 14""? It seemed small, and no leftovers. Also even with a coupon that 14"" pie was about $25. Really? Me no likey.

Great on taste, but would be cool to have more size options for delivery. Also, very limited app selection."
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Kara S.,"The pizza here is so delicious. I ordered on a weeknight for a quick dinner via Eat24. It arrived sooner than expected. I got a small veggie pizza with pineapple. The ingredients were super fresh. The sauce was subtle, light and complex. The crust was THE best part and I'm not normally a crust person, but the crust here was the perfect blend of chewy and crispy and cooked perfectly. Seriously so good. And for the price, you can't beat it. I highly recommend!"
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Sara F.,This is my absolute favorite neighborhood pizza stop. Both the regular slices and the pan pizzas are delicious!  Sauce is boss and lots of melted cheese.  The service is ALWAYS fast and friendly - I have always had great experiences here. The people who work here are the best and always go above and beyond to make sure evwrything is satisfactory.  I highly recommend the Jumbo Slice w/ drink deal!!
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Kris L.,Tried this place looking for artisan pizza but soggy crust and light on toppings is a meh for me.
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Taylor R.,"Some of the best pizza I've ever had, period. 

No frills, no gimmicks - just fresh tasting ingredients and crispy, delicious crust. Their jumbo slice is my favorite. It's a full quarter of a maybe 14"" almost New York style pizza cut into 4 pieces with a can of soda for $6.50 all-in. Their full pies are fantastic as well, and well worth the additional cost over the chain pizza places. 

I see the same faces every time I go in, and they're always welcoming you in with a smile. Support local businesses - especially when they're above and beyond what else is out there. Thank you for the consistently great pizza!"
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Ruben M.,"You know what's better then good pizza? Living a block away from an amazing pizza place.

My first experience with this place was ordering a pizza for my roommate and I. It was affordable, VERY delicious and made in good time.  My second experience, when I had gotten out of a rough relationship and was ""dating myself"".  On that second visit is when I learned to love them, for the self-dates.  They have a cheap meal for one, type of thing, or a cute little date at a hole in the wall. $6 for 2-3 HUGE slices of pizza + a can of pop.  It's simple, very effective, especially if you're gonna sit in the restaurant which is never busy, and read a book while enjoying ""me"" time. :)

I highly recommend this place.  If anything, take yourself on a date and bring a good book.

PS.  The canoli's are to-die-for!"
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Ben S.,"I just moved a couple blocks away from Paula and Monica's.  I was up late unpacking boxes, and was in desperate need of beer and pizza.  Opening up Grubhub, this place popped up as one of the closest pizza shops.  I wasn't expecting much, I just wanted something fast and filling.  I ordered a large cheese pizza and a caesar salad.  The pizza was phenomenal!  Crust was cooked perfectly with just the right cheese to sauce ratio.  Some of the best thin crust I've had in the city.  I've never actually been to NY, but I'd imagine this is how their pizza is supposed to taste.

This will definitely be my go-to pizza spot from now on, good work!"
paula-and-monicas-pizzeria-chicago,Erin B.,Our pizza was delivered fast and was piping hot. The veggie pizza was delicious and they really load on the toppings. Will definitely be ordering from them again.
local-foods-cafe-chicago-2,Kristen S.,Best BLT I've ever had. The staff was friendly and attentive as well. I will 100% be back for brunch or lunch along with spegrocery shopping.
local-foods-cafe-chicago-2,Michael C.,"I seriously love this small restaurant in this grocery store. Ordered the grits, greens, and eggs along with a coffee. It was close to closing time so the INCREDIBLY nice chef that cooked my meal also gave me a free cinnamon roll. She was so down to Earth and friendly!

I feel like the food I ate that day had a certain quality that is incredibly difficult to find. Everything had a certain ""crispness"" and emphasized the incredible flavors of the individuals pieces alone. Together it was absolutely heaven. 

I should also take time to note that I will ALWAYS get a cinnamon roll whenever I come back now. It was soft, warm, and not too sweet. Not usually the type to order desserts, but I can't resist here. I was absolutely in love with it all."
local-foods-cafe-chicago-2,Kateryna G.,"It's a small grocery store/butcher and cafe all in one space. I got cherry tomatoes which were expensive but delicious so they get one star for those. Prepared food, on the other hand, is nothing to write home about and is terribly over priced. I felt more ripped off that I usually do at Whole Foods. The duck entree I ordered was $15 but had a tiny piece of overdone and over salted duck and a little salad."
local-foods-cafe-chicago-2,Lee T.,"This is farm to table at It's best.  I've had lunch here a couple of times.  Have had the burger and the BLT.  Both excellent.  It is also a grocery store with items from local farmers.  I thought the menu was excellent. 
I noticed that one of the reviewers gave Local Foods 1 * as he thought it was pricey.  I don't think it is pricey for what you get."
local-foods-cafe-chicago-2,Eric T.,"Walked over from the Metra station to have a bite before our train came. Sat down at the counter and waited about five minutes before getting acknowledged. Finally a sullen woman came by and plopped down menus in front of us before continuing the neglect. Having no faith in timely service we took off not trusting we'd make our train. No one said anything or asked if things were ok, though it's hard not to be seen leaving as te whole kitchen is open. The food we did see looked great but this was a major service and courtesy fail for us."
local-foods-cafe-chicago-2,Ben R.,Five stars all day long. Quiet and spacious. Food and service were excellent.great selection of beer and they make their own sausage.
local-foods-cafe-chicago-2,Laura A.,"Love Stock.  Need to get there more often.  I've never had anything bad there.  I appreciate how Chef Abra switches things up so the menu is not stagnant, and it's not large so every item can be prepared well.  I appreciate the nod to Midwest cuisine, and their dedication to avoid food waste.  The Kombucha and beef fat potatoes are 2 favorites.  The baked treats I've tried have all been tasty as well.  The only thing I don't like are the stools at the counter.  They go with the clean look of the store and counter, but they're super uncomfortable.  Good for a quick meal!"
local-foods-cafe-chicago-2,Elyse K.,"Really cute restaurant inside of an equally cute specialty grocer. The food was very tasty, fresh and filling, if a little on the pricy side. I had brunch with sorority sisters, my husband, and a baby and the staff was accommodating and it was a good pick for a new mom.  Parking, automatic front door, but it could be a bit more accessible- it was a bit hard to navigate a normal-sized stroller through the not-automatic inner doors, and the aisles are narrow. The doors to the bathrooms weren't accessible- but none of these were deal breakers for a small group... however, I could imagine it would be difficult for a wheelchair. That being said, it was really good and I would return!"
local-foods-cafe-chicago-2,Lizzy P.,"Brunch was great.  Surprised it wasn't crowded-  was here on a Saturday morning around 10:30, ordered with no wait, and had our food within minutes.  Also saw that they are BYOB.  Can't wait to come back.  Food was fantastic, service was friendly and quick.  Best of all they are farm to table.   
Also there was free parking available.  No issue finding a spot."
local-foods-cafe-chicago-2,Lisa B.,Restaurant in locally sourced market. Free parking. Good food hidden off elston at north avenue. Had hash and eggs. Yummy. Also have monthly dinners by guest chefs and good take away dinners
local-foods-cafe-chicago-2,Kelly N.,What a find!  Stumbled upon this place for lunch after attending a baby yoga class.  Serving some of the best farm to table food - really fresh ingredients with a constantly changing menu. Chef Abra Berens does a fantastic job bringing together seasonal flavors. When I was in (now a couple months ago) I had a grilled peach sandwich with bacon as well as one of the recommended treats for dessert with fabulous seasonal berries. Everything tastes great. Would definitely make a point to come back again.
local-foods-cafe-chicago-2,Ray S.,"From the quality of food to the delivery, this place is great. I loved my split pea soup here and the bread and cheese was phenomenal. Really clean too and a nice space."
local-foods-cafe-chicago-2,Meghan F.,"My husband and I stopped in to Stock for lunch and it was awesome! He had a delicious pastie, which not only met the high expectations of our northern Michigan roots, but also improved upon what we expected because the chef nailed the pastry crust. YUM. I was craving veggies and had a perfect green, crunchy sandwich with arugula, cucumbers, and cream cheese. Best of all, we found out we could take some frozen pasties home with us for those week nights that we're too busy to cook. Can't recommend this place enough - it's fresh and local stuff from people who care (they're all really nice) and in a fun environment. Do it!"
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Ryann D.,"I love this place. They have the best food in the neighborhood and the prices are beyond reasonable. I've had slices to go and whole pies delivered. Good sauce, fresh ingredients, ridiculously flavorful. The meatball sandwich with cheese and hot peppers is fantastic, perfectly seasoned. Staff is cool, competent and nice. Unbelievably great service, even late night. It's the ideal neighborhood pizzeria. I feel honored and lucky to live nearby."
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Mina N.,"I really love this place for the tasty pizza slices.  I don't like my pizza reheated and sometimes the pizza sits too long and they want to reheat it. Not good!

I love that pizza fresh out the oven is the best.
The dough is crispy and thin. The sauce is perfect a little on the sweet side just how I love and the cheese is perfect.  They must use quality ingredients because you can taste it. 

There is seating available so if you want to eat in.  The tables do lack attention most of the time and the music they play is a little too much on the ears

Parking is terrible in this area"
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Christina S.,"Their pizza has won awards which they advertise with a pamphlet on their pizza box. These awards include:  ""Best Neighborhood Grub"" by Chicago Magazine and ""Voted Chicago's Best Pizza"" by Chicago Reader.  And they are not kidding!

The BBQ pizza that I ordered was probably the most carefully decorated pizza I have ever seen-not only did it look beautiful-but it was delicious!  Each ingredient complimented the next-from the savory and fresh cilantro sprigs to the sweetness of the barbecue sauce to the tender chicken and onions!

In addition I ordered the side salad-in which the salad mix was a variety of spring mix with fresh cherry tomatoes, crunchy julienned carrots, fresh cucumber slices, and delicious and classy Newman's Own Italian salad dressing.  

Would order again in a heartbeat!"
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Amber A.,"Wow wow wow ! First time to Chicago and first restaurant I picked was the best decision ever . Walked in immediately greeted and welcomed , great menu and upbeat staff . Food was absolutely delicious and forsure the best Chicago pizza ever ! Literally wouldn't eat pizza anywhere else ! Stop in and see them they r phenomenal! Owner Chris is super kind and attentive made sure we left happy and full thanks pie eyed pizza for the best experiences ever ."
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Nicholas M.,"A fine lowkey pizza joint in the city. Great looking menu, great looking prices, and of course great tasting pizza. But that's not what made me like this place. I absolutely love the service here. Everyone who works at Pie-eyed is so kind and hospitable that for a moment, I forgot I was at a fast food joint. Such nice workers, and the interior of this place is very well done. I love all of the pictures they have on the walls and the Chicago decor everywhere. 

Would definitely come back to try their other food, because all I've tried so far was a slice and some cheesy garlic bread (both were absolutely delicious)."
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Denise T.,"This review is more about the delivery. I ordered a pepperoni pizza at 11:03am, 3 minutes after they opened, to be delivered to my school. The person that answered the phone said about an hour; I made sure that they can deliver it around my lunch period because otherwise I'll just order from the numerous pizza places around the area. 
They didn't deliver the pizza until 12:35pm!!! My school is a 2 minute drive / 6 minute walk from their restaurant!!!!!!!!! 
He delivered it as my lunch period ended. The lady on the phone was no help either."
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Cook S.,"A Slice of Thin Crust Pizza / Cheese
Review: The sauce was dried, the cheese was bland and it seems to be the pizza was there for a while. If they cared, they would of gotten me a new slice instead of serving me an old slice of pizza. Where's the customer service? Compare to the dollar slice in New York, this slice costed me $4.00 for one, never again guys..."
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Jamaal M.,"Great pizza, hands down!!! The only reason it didn't get 5*s was the price. I got 2 $5 slices but I think they should have been priced a little cheaper (around $4 or $3.50).  Just my opinion, still great stuff though."
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Julie S.,"I was hoping to love this place. It's conveniently by the Chicago blue line stop and sells pizza by the slice or the pie. I picked up 2 slices to go for a friend and me. The slices are pretty large, and the guy behind the counter was friendly. He offered a free side of ranch and cracked a joke or two. The pizza itself though is very mediocre. Perhaps, if you're drunk and starving it'll do the trick!"
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Connor M.,Over priced for the quality of pizza. 5 for a thin slice    That is pretty small isn't worth it.
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Matthew G.,Got greeted by GJ! Best place to get pizza for lunch or dinner! I will be back! Must recommend!
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Russell V.,Pizza is ok. Got a slice to go. Crust was like a weak cracker that crumbled in several places. The pizza I had would have been better if it was sliced in squares. At $5 for one Pepperoni slice it's not a great value. Probably good for a late night spot when nothing else is open.
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Fluffles M.,"This place is just alright. Look - it's clean, the service is always nice, everyone who works there knows the deal. The pizza is a slice of pizza. No more - no less. 

I used to go here because it's within walking distance of my work - and other then a construction crew or 2 coming in to order 15 slices, it's relatively chill and not busy. 

Then the yuppies came. God. Dammit. 

The Milwaukee blue line stop is literally in front of Pie Eyed. You could literally walk up to the street and just fall to your left and you will land inside this shop. As such - it's become a little hot spot for white collars bringing their WHOLE GOD DAMN OFFICE to eat this TOTALLY WHATEVER pie. 

I'm sure they LOVE it. Leave 5 star reviews and the whole fucking shebang. I've already seen a few. This pizza is not ""thebomb.com"" as others would tell you. 

It is ""totallyacceptable.net"" 

I like this place. I hate the crowd. But what do I know? I'm just a little kitty."
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,marc r.,"My favorite local place - The pizza is decent but everything else is even better, in my honest opinion. Best italian sub for the price, slices are cheap & big. Can't really go wrong with this place.

Cheese fries for the win!"
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Constance F.,"The food here is so flipping good! Forgot to post a couple weeks ago but I had an Italian beef and hotwings. Let me just say the Italian beef here is soooooo tender and the bread always tastes fresh. The hotwings are bomb as well, perfectly sauced!! I'm happy that this plc is within walking distance of my place. This is my special little go to spot. Nice prices as well and good portion sizes. I love and loathe this place. Try it guys!"
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Angie Nicole N.,"Customer service is horrible! They wouldn't let me use their restroom even tho they don't have a sign saying ""no restroom"" so you'd think they had one available after you buy food and eat a full meal you're going to have to use the restroom but they wouldn't let me! And their pizza was soggy!"
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Davey B.,"This place is extremely questionable.  It's a divey, whole-in-the-wall pizza joint but even for those standards it was unsatisfactory.  The pizza was cardboard and clearly re-heated and the sides are stanky and straight from the freezer into the fryer.  The problems don't end there -- the dining area looks like it hasn't been upgraded in like 10 years (run down chairs, dirty tables, kitchen looked nasty) and the staff was not particularly friendly and in need of showers and more proper hygiene.  

You do not need to waste your time trying this place... D'Agostino's right around the corner is WAY better in terms of cheap pizza."
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Stephanie L.,"This place is gross

Cardboard, flavorless pizza.

We were hoping to find our local go to and we found bad pizza."
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Charlie P.,"Well since writing the review earlier this year, I did find pizza nearly as good as this. However it's in my neighborhood. I'd hate to see it overrun with people who might not really appreciate good pie. If you really want to know, look at my check ins or PM me. Still, I'll be back at Pie-Eyed next time I'm over in Wicker Park."
pie-eyed-pizzeria-chicago,Brian K.,"Got a delivery order for a 16"" thin crust pepperoni and a 10"" Chicago deep dish pepperoni and sausage. Delivery was pretty quick and the pizza was hot, awesome. The thin crust was a great balance of crust, sauce, and cheese. Crust was not crispy, but soft and not soggy one bit. It was cooked perfectly. Nothing really stood out to me, but in a good way; it was simply good pizza that would appeal to anyone. The deep dish was alright. It was very messy. There could have been a little less sauce, but this didn't stop me from enjoying it. It was also cooked very well. Pie-Eyed is delicious, good value, and convenient. No complaints on my end."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,John L.,"Went here for a Friday Night concert ""The Randy Rogers Band"" this place brings in Red Dirt Road music which is great! the crowd was friendly and to place is small and is easy to be right up in the front, even got a drumstick! I would recommend this place."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Shay R.,"I was originally introduced to Joe's via a kickball league that I joined. I participated in that kickball league for two seasons so I have been too Joe's way too many times. Joe's is a great bar for sports leagues because they have great drinks deals and food (for leagues). 


Outside of the league I've visited Joe's a handful of times and it has been a hit or miss experience. Unfortunately Joe's is the kind of place that seems like they are looking for any reason to squeeze a few extra bucks out of you. 

I visited on a Saturday night and they forced us to stand in a long line that didn't move, even though we could see how empty it was inside. My friend asked the bouncier, prior to standing in the line, if we would have to pay the price for the concert even if we just want to grab a drink and chill in the bar area. We were told we wouldn't have to pay but once we finally got inside we were told that we had to pay the concert charge. 

The guy collecting was super rude and could care less if we were there to spend money. We decided to get out of there and not give them any money. We ended up going to a bar up the street. 

I can truly only see myself going to Joe's during the summertime to enjoy the rooftop."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,David C.,"Found this place on Eventbrite for reggae rooftop party . Great view, great service and strong drinks. The atmosphere was nice. The staff were nice. Drinks were reasonably priced.  Next time; I'll come checkout the inside of the bar.  

The music was live. The DJ was good but I wanted him to play more reggae. He kept mixing in pop music. 

The parking was hit or miss. Thankfully; I was able to find a parking spot on the corner.. too good to be true.   

Due to it supposedly be a reggae event; the crowd was fairly mixed.  I will have to comeback to see otherwise"
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Nicole K.,"Horrible security that will do nothing when you bring them a problem.  
Not ADA compliant and do not care.  
Generic response to complaints - we will speak with our staff.  Which is basically a brush off and we all know that means they will ignore it and go on as they were."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Mimi L.,"This is a typical sports bar with a lot of different TV screens playing different sport games. The pizza was actually above average for a sports bar - nothing truly amazing but here is what made it great:

$5 for 10 inch cheese pizza with $1.25 each additional topping on Tuesday nights! $5 cover if you come in after 8 pm. 

There is also a dance floor + bar in the back where it got pretty crowded around 10 pm. The music being played was a range from Jennifer Lopez to teach me how to dougie days, and some mainstream. Pretty cheesy and so was the pizza (ha ha). It was overall still a fun place. Count me in on a Tuesday but I don't see myself going in on any other day."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Danyelle G.,"I've been to this venue to do concerts and it's great . The customer service is really great and the concert area in the back is awesome.

They have a great selection of food here. I've done the VIP buffet during concerts and everything served was great!

They hold concerts here all the time, mainly country. So if you are looking for a fun night out, I'd look to see who they have coming here next! It's not too pricy and good for all ages 21+ I would say.

They also host cool events here like Harry Potter night and more. Def a cool bar to check out!"
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Kelsey S.,"[This review is for the rooftop only]

I had a perfect night on the rooftop at Joe's with friends.  They featured an amazing live band (South City Revival) who played a lively 3-hour set.  Nachos and buffalo chicken dip were highlights on the food menu.  When I was at Joe's I experienced perfect weather, rustic string lighting, plenty of seating, folks dancing, and attentive waitresses bringing cold, cheap drinks.  If you're looking for a casual rooftop experience, this is the place to be.

Only caveat: the liquor seemed to be a bit watered down, so I would suggest purchasing beer or wine."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Kathleen G.,"So... rocked up to this joint with low expectations but was pleasantly surprised when we had a spot to grab some food and a drink during Rivalry Weekend. Sadly things went from bad to down right awful! Service was a single person in a rammed place which meant we suffered throughout the afternoon. The 1-Star comes from the dog-sh*t cheap ""champagne"" served as a well known $5.99 high-street brand that appeared on the check as $60!! Yes $60!! Despite being $8 a glass (expensive but ridiculous and equal to $32 a bottle worth). When challenged in a friendly manner we were asked if we'd ever had bottle service at the club... it's just disappointing, we paid, left and won't be back. If here... enjoy, just check your bill! xx"
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Marcia T.,"I have only been to Joe's on Tuesdays as they have their special. On Tuesdays, its $5 for 10 inch pizza with $1.25 each for additional topping. A pitcher of beer (Bud Light) is only $2. There is a cover from 6-8 PM, I believe? and times afterwards you need to paid. 

The service here is what it is. On a Tuesday, they probably are not ready for a large crowd. Getting a server was not  problem, but getting orders were. We ordered two large pizza with fries and waited nearly a hour or so. Came in very hungry and even mentioned it to the waiter that we were. At one point, we were getting delusion from hunger. Before the first order of pizza came out, it began to get more crowded and so we decided to order another two orders pizza since it was already taking so long. Time had pass and still nothing from our first order, and so one of us orders a pitcher of beer. You would think we would get that pretty quickly since its just something you fill up. That took a while too.

Eventually our first order of pizza with fries came out and luckily we were able to get the beer before this. The pizza is super hot and we are burning our mouths. We did not care as we were super hungry. Our other friends from other tables did not get their food either and were starving as well. The fries that came with our food.... you can tell the fries were finished long before the pizza was as the fries were tough. The fries were not salted well as some pieces had too much or no salt at all. It was not too long before our second order of pizza came out and our friends in the other table STILL did not get their order of pizza. We were pretty sure when we ordered our second round of pizza that they already ordered their first.

I really think Joe's was not ready to take so many orders even though they knew their specials gets a lot of people to come in to their place.

Come prepare to wait on a Tuesday night, even if you get seated and the bar is not even full yet!"
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Allie B.,"Large bar that is suitable for big events. I was at Joe's for a large social gathering (~200-300 people if I had to guess) and there was so much space to mingle. The food was good. I'm not sure if it was catered in or not, but I was into it. The music was loud enough to hear which song was playing but quiet enough that you could still have a small-group conversation. I also really liked that the party room was separated from the rest of the bar."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Geovany C.,So in the back bar apparently the bartenders dont give back your change back? Just remember when your getting drunk make sure the bartenders don't rip you off
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Joe M.,"Decent bar. Mostly we go to Joe's for the comedy show. We've had their Calabrese salad and it was delicious, other than that it's your typical bar food but it was all good."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Bob Z.,"I used UberEats to order lunch. I ordered their RibTips and the Wings. 

Holy cow - both are winners.  The rib tips are huge and the sauce is fantastic. They are smoked and tender but not fall apart over-cooked.  Great taste and texture. I'm definitely having these again (and again). 

The wings are also smoked with a really good dry rub. Medium sized, not huge and not small, and an order is a lot of food.  So good and they cooked them well. 

Definitely great food and a good lunch option."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Joe M.,"My rating is truly 3.5, but a round up was in order due to their trivia on Wednesdays.  Twice I have attended Seinfeld trivia, and it is a ton of fun.  The service is on point.  Both times, I have had an attentive, courteous, and fun waitress.  I would never order liquor drinks here, just beer.  I'm told the liquor drinks are a little watered down.

The food is simple, and bland.  Nothing I have eaten here is something to write home about, but the trivia and entertainment is worth it.  2-2.5 hour trivia that is competitive and challenging based on certain subjects; Seinfeld, Harry Potter, Disney, etc.  It's always a good time and you can reserve a table of six in advance.

The experience and service is great.  If their food was better, I would probably come by more often.  Make sure you come on a trivia night though, great outing with friends."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Kaitlin I.,"Been here for two concerts, Cody Johnson and Randy Rogers Band. For both companies concerts they oversold. They are too crowded. I normally stand in the back and just enjoy the music and standing up against the wall I was still getting bumped into and shoved around. It's ridiculous how many people they allow in here. Also, the sound wasn't very good. Speakers turned up full blast, just sounds like a mess. I thought maybe the first concert was just an off day for the venue. Second concert was just as bad. Will not be coming back unfortunately."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Sonya M.,"Wow! I hadn't been to Joe's in years! It's nice to know that some things never change. I visited to check out the Mikey O. Cinco de Mayo comedy show after my co-worker received free tickets. 

The show started at 7pm so we arrived 20 minutes early and waited briefly before being seated. Most people had already arrived so we avoided the crowds and got a great seat in the back of the venue with a perfect view. 

Our waitress greeted us promptly and was very attentive throughout the evening. She even made sure a couple of seats were saved in case some additional friends showed up. The service was great but I cant say the same for the food or drinks. I split the chicken tenders with  my sister and ordered a margarita. The chicken fingers were undercooked and the margarita wasn't very good. I was really disappointed with the food.

The comedy show and atmosphere more than made up for the unsatisfactory food though. The crowd was chill and the employees were all enthusiastic. Exiting was as uneventful as entering. We took the train rather than brave the traffic and had no problems leaving. One of my friends drove and he said he paid $30 to park.

I think I'll check out Joe's calendar of events more often and visit again soon."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Hannah P.,Reliably decent sports bar with good food.
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Jennifer P.,"I came here to the rooftop for a day party event on a Sunday, June 11, 2017, that I found out about on EventBrite.  I made sure to get to the event early (so I wouldn't have to pay for entrance).  My cousin and I, were able to get a table so that we could eat and drink.  The event filled up, and it turned into standing room only.  The food was decent.  I ordered three tacos which came with chips, salsa and guacamole.  My cousin ordered a taco salad.  Both were extremely filling.  Drinks were good too.  

Since it was a hot day, it got pretty hot, with no umbrellas or shade.  But hey, this is SummertimeChi so get used to it.  

Overall, we had a pretty good time."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Lindsay F.,"This is the worst service I've ever had in awhile. Waitress took our order and within less than 5 min had already run up our check and gave us our bill, even though we did not ask for it, were in no hurry, but apparently she sure was!  But no biggie, we figured that if we wanted to order more, we could just have a second bill or update it.  This was NOT the case however, and our waitress rudely told us to go to the bar for more orders of drinks.

15 minutes after the food of buffalo wings and fries came, we still had no napkins, plates or catsup, etc.  I asked the waitress but she cut me off as such:

Me: Excuse me, I am sorry to bother, but I was wondering if it were possible to get some-
Waitress: yea catsup, silverware and napkins, yea, i know, i got it, hold on!! (rudely).

I was so taken aback that I couldn't respond.  When the catsup did come, the bottle was empty.  At this point, I didn't bother to try to flag her down.  Same with plates.  I shared the 10 buffalo wings (although the wings we got were smokey wings) and big basket of fries, and it was kinda gross to eat without plates.  We didn't have a place for our discarded bones, so we placed them precariously ontop of a tiny square napkin (the ones that come with drinks?).  The sauce and grease from the chicken and fries soaked through the napkins  and made a fine mess on the table.  Again, by this time the waitress was walking by pointedly ignoring us, or asking us to finish paying the bill.  

I came here for the Boy Band Night, which is AWESOME! but the venue was terrible.  I seriously have never had such bad service and left giving her a $1.65 tip on a $16 bill.  Skip the bar and restaurant, and if you want to see the Boy Band, go to a different venue."
joes-on-weed-st-chicago,Jacques M.,"A friend and I stopped in here last Friday to see the Micro Wrestling Wrestling Federation. This is a pro wrestling organization that prominently features Little People. Hey...don't judge me, everyone has their own tastes when it comes to entertainment. 

From a decor standpoint, this is pretty much your standard Sports Bar. A lot of seating in the front with a large bar in the back and bunch of TV's plastered on the wall. However, they had a better beer selection then I was expecting. In fact, they even had Bell's Hop Slam on tap, which is a delicious IPA that's fairly difficult to find. Horse Races were showing in the room to the right of the bar. I'm not sure if there is off-track betting or not, but some people seemed really into the races.

The crowd was an interesting mix of ""bros"" and suburbanites. Joe's probably isn't the classiest bar in town, but you can have a decent time if you come in with the right mindset. While it's not a place I would frequently regularly, the right event could certainly lure me back."
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Ijf K.,"I'm a big fan of da pizza dude, been eating there almost weekly for more than a year now. 

They're everything a food truck should be:

* Fast
* Delicious
* Friendly staff

I'll admit that I am slightly biased since they always stop right next to our office building, but I've really never had a bad experience there. Unlike other pizza trucks you don't have to wait 10 minutes for your pizza, and they're only using good ingredients, some of them even organic. 

If you like pizza and are close to da dude, then I'd highly recommend grabbing one."
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Zachary S.,"This truck is amazing, fresh ingredients and a few options to satisfy most of the pizza eating public. A must stop for anyone who loves pizza or those curious about the lunch trucks. This pizza is the real deal Italian authentic."
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Rossana A.,"I go here every day on my way to school and it never fails to be the best pizza I've had! Tastes just like the pizza I had in Italy, you can really taste the quality of the pizza. The margarita is my fav!!!"
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Austin H.,"Grabbed a slice here on lunch, and it was a great experience. I got the Chicago combo, and it was amazing. It was spicy, but not too hot, the slice was big enough to be filling, and the service was fantastic. There are some really great food trucks in Chicago, and this is one of them."
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Louli S.,"Great pepperoni pizza! Thin crust just the right lunch portion for a quick bite, then back to the office thanks Pizza Dudes on Wacker!"
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Marianne D.,"I was at the Lincoln Park Zoo Food Truck Social last night and I have to say that this was my favorite truck.  Okay, the crispy pastrami fries from the Fat Pickle Truck was fantastic, but I was blown away by the product Da Pizza Dude produced in a truck.  I ordered the prosciutto pizza.  The crust was perfectly done...crispy with air bubbles and light.  Just like the pizza I love when in Italy.  Plenty of prosciutto, arugula and parmesan were piled on top and the sauce was very tasty.  At the end of the evening, I went back to inquire if they'd do a late night snack at my step-daughter's wedding in Naperville...and they would!  Seriously thinking about this truck as a special treat on her wedding day.  Great job, guys!  Let me know if you're truck comes to my area for any events!"
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Brett G.,"Da Pizza, Dude! Everyone should always respond to my texts immediately"
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Karen C.,"Ummmm... this might be my favorite pizza food truck downtown. The pies are the perfect size for lunch, not too small, not too big, and the crust is fantastic! Definitely legit-Italian crust... reminds me of Spacca Napoli crust, which is my favorite.

Meatballs, Veggies, Pepperoni & many other choices... I dig on the classic Margherita, it's delicious, and the price is really good considering the size. 

My only teeny-tiny complaint would be that cans of cold beverages should not be $3. That's crazy. I pick up my pie & then run into good ol' Walgreens for a drink."
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Jeff G.,"We hired Da Pizza Dude to swing by our house to cater our daughters graduation party. The pizza was fantastic and was a hit by everyone. He also supplied us with trays of Italian Beef and Sausage and Peppers with rolls. The food was hot, fast, and delicious. Nobody left with an empty stomach, and everyone raved about his pizza. I will definitely have to keep my eye out for him on the street and grab another pizza while on lunch. Great food, great service, and great people."
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Kevin C.,"Had the Chicago combo  for dinner when they parked outside of my building this evening. Amazing pizza considering it's out of a food truck, the sausage, amount of tomato sauce and the crust were perfect. It was also a very short wait and the dough was freshly made."
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Danielle D.,"Best pizza ever! The pies are made different than your typical circular pizza as they are intended to be sized for individual enjoyment rather than shared with large groups. But even still, they are plenty big and filling! They also have some awesome options and my favorite is the Pro which is Prosciutto + Arugula + Shaved Parmesan + Topped with EVOO... and it's amazing! I also love the meatball and the margarita pizzas! The pizzas are made fresh right on the truck and the owner is super nice and friendly. I highly recommend tracking down this pizza truck if you live in Chicago and enjoy delicious, fresh, Italian style pies!"
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Jill O.,"I've walked past this truck a million times but usually don't (not because I don't wanna) eat pizza for lunch. But...today I had a craving for some 'za that just couldn't be beat and decided to try a Peppe. HOLY MOLY is this pizza good. It was crunchy and chewy and gooey and piping hot. It's like there's a wood burning oven just driving around the Loop! I definitely won't be eating pizza for lunch on the reg, but for an occasional craving or treat this pie totally hits the spot. That's amore!"
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Kerri H.,Had the Chicago Combo today and it was very good.  Liked that you could get it with mild or hot Giardiniera.  Walked right by the Chicago Pizza Boss because i am a leader and not a follower!!!  I have never been disappointed with any pizza from Da Pizza Dude!
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Vishal B.,"there are very few places for good simple pizza in the loop. especially pizza for one. something just right for lunch or on the go. I didn't expect such a fresh tasting pizza from a truck. they didn't have a huge line and pizza took 4 minutes. the Margherita is something else! I could taste basil in each bite and the sauce was clearly fresh made, no sour canned taste. maybe it's just because pizza has a way of hitting the spot, I am glad I gave them a shot.. will actively seek them out when I'm craving pizza next time. good value too!"
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,malone j.,This is my favorite pizza!!!! And to think it comes from a truck!!!! The crust is perfect it's crispy not soggy and not burnt it's perfect.  The price is really reasonable for being in the city! We went there last week and can't wait to have it again soon!!
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Mary B.,"This place is by FAR the best pizza food truck around. The pizzas are perfectly portioned - not too much for one person, or you could split in half to share or save. 

The crust is delicious - chewy and crispy all at once. The toppings are great too - flavorful sauce, no skimping on cheese, and lots of variety. 

It's also run by the nicest people. The main guy (I think he's the owner, he's been there both times I've had it) is a young guy who works really hard to be friendly and make sure you're happy. 

Next time, I need to try the appetizers! 

Excellent!"
da-pizza-dude-chicago-3,Jeff K.,First time trying this today. Pretty impressive tastes coming out of a truck and excellent crust !
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Mysel O.,"Regular fast food joint. Food is fresh place is clean. I always get the Grilled Chicken sandwich on garlic bread. Delicious! I haven't tried their breakfast yet. Will do soon

11.8.17 UPDATE I finally got their breakfast it was fast and fresh for $6. Can't beat that!"

stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Cinthya Q.,"Tried this place this weekend and it was very delicious.  Sometimes you just want a delicious, throwback burger that is charbroiled and juicy.  Come here. Is it the cheapest place?  No, is it incredibly expensive, no.   Though nestled in the industrial corridor of Elston Ave.; it is in between Lincoln Park and WIcker Park/ Bucktown, add city taxes, and you've got these prices. 

It's a 'greasy spoon' type of diner, lots of fast food options.  We tried the burgers, fries, and the gyros.  All were very good; the burger and gyros were nice and juicy, the fries were good (though I am sure if they were frozen of freshly made).  They advertise their charbroiled chicken which I am interested in trying next.  

The place seemed very clean and super organized.  The accouterments behind the counter were so organized it made my OCD heart smile."
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,William Q.,"I stopped by for a brunch kind of meal. I ordered a corned beef skillet and it was on point. Hefty portion, fresh and savory. Customer service was good, the waitress friendly and service oriented, the same is true for the bus boy. Reasonable price and overall a good experience. If I recommend it????"
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Amy W.,First time visiting. Food was pretty goid but a bit pricey. Had the Cream of Mushroom soup which was very flavorful. I also ordered the Greek salad which was huge and enough for two people
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,James W.,"What a great place for lunch in that part of Chicago!  All five in our party were impressed with the quality of the delicious foods served, quantity in the generous portions, variety of foods offered, the friendly servers and the cleanliness of the restaurant and wash room.  My gyro and fries were excellent,  and I heard the others state the chicken quarters, rice, veggies, burgers and wraps were amazing."
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Marti M.,"Grilled chicen salad is HUGE and fresh and the chicken is great! No weird grey or ""funky pieces"" that look lille fake meat here! It's great! The staff are super friendly and they offer free wifi!

The little table for two on the right by the window gets all the sun at noon so it;s pleasant to sit there and be warm. :)"
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Theo S.,Great place not your average fast food restaurant. Healthy alternatives including chicken fantastic rice potatoes i recomend. My go to when im in the area.
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Jeff S.,"The burger was good, I was in a happy place eating it and was almost finished before noticing the entire place was crawling with ants and some other type of bug. I got a few pictures too of the ants.

Kind of scares me thinking of what is in their kitchen"
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Frank J.,"This also ran by the same family as the produce store across the street. Been here 3 times...twice for breakfast and today for lunch. The young ladies that work here are always smiling and cordial. It's usually slow and mellow during breakfast time but t was surely popping during lunch time. Breakfast is not the best I've had but can't be beat for the quality and quantity you receive with such a great price! Denver omelette w/potatoes and toast for $5.65...Wow! Service is quick as well...even when busy. For lunch, I just had two things I was craving for...Gyro Meat and French fries together...Grub...Grub! I also like their nice seating arrangement for a medium sized restaurant along with two flat screen tv's! Good place for some grub for breakfast and lunch...NOT open for dinner!"
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Joseph M.,"Just paid $6.50 for a hotdog and fries. So i either got ripped off or they charged me for 2. Which is what i asked for. Either way Home Depot across the street is fresher and cheaper.

Food was ok and I actually like the naturally grungy but not too grungy atmosphere.  Gyro on the spigot is always key. 

Regardless they screwed the order up so I wont go back.  Big city with many restaurants that don't make mistakes like that."
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Alex H.,I wish I could give this place one star first off food was garbage never eating here again rather go next door to arts drive in second of all they messed up my order. There was a ugly Mexican cashier that had the worst attitude ever her name was Maria or something I mean first of all she screws up my order and has the nerve to give me an attitude for her mistake? Am I missing something here? Terrible service awful over priced food save your money and go to arts drive in
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Alex Z.,"Their white rice with veggies is absolutely delicious.  Ordered a side of it and it was probably 2-3 cups for under $2. Not salty.  Not mushy.  Not dry.  Give it a try...you wont be disappointed 
Also had the half chicken meal... Delicious.  That is basically the only thing I can say about it lol.  Try it.  You wont be disappointed.  And the price is good too... Under $10 for half a chicken, rice, vegetables and a pita bread"
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,AV G.,three stars--A-OK exactly right.  Place is cheap and clean--decent counter service food.  A lot of cab drivers and city workers--2 unambitious groups who can be relied upon for decent lunch values.  I think the place has some connection to the real Stanley s across the street--veg of the day was broccoli which they served by the ton.  When i went to buy veg across the street--they had a ton for sale. 1/4 chicken dinner with broc and rice--$7.  Quite decent.  Breakfast looks cheap and nice.  Parking lot and wifi.  One of the best values on the northside.
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Katie S.,"I work in the area and Stanley's is the perfect lunch place to run to for a fast meal.  They have an extensive menu that's priced a little on the high-side.  They say they are famous for their chicken- 100% the truth.  I usually go with the tenders, but all their chicken is super tender inside with that nice crisp skin on the outside.  

Their salads are overpriced but it hasn't stopped me from ordering them.  I always get their Cesar salad with chicken.  It comes with garlic bread that is seriously addicting.  It is the main reason i keep going back.  

Other favorites- Cajun chicken sandwich-not over spicy and super tender. Gyro Sandwich (huge amount of meat that is much cheaper than the gyro plate).  Cheeseburger-thin burgers, but super juicy.  And Every single breakfast sandwich.

I always go at lunch time so it is busy, but the longest I've waited for a to-go order was about 10 min.  When ordering the salads it's about 3 minutes.  Everything is made to order so I have never thought I was waiting too long.  

The daily people in Stanley's are locals who work in the area.  It's nice to see a place that has regulars, but if you're in the area it's a great diner to check out!"
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Richard C.,"This is a hidden gem. The food her is always hot, fresh and delicious. This has been a go to for years. The chicken is excellent. Inside is clean and the staff is nice. They have a daily veggie. Parking in rear. Fresh made salsa is great. Garlic bread spot on. BBQ sauce is served hot and is spot on"
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Don M.,Awesome gyros plate a very good portion and the taste is over the top I love this place great neighborhood joint with lots of choices
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Omar K.,"I was brought here by a friend about a year ago. and have been coming at least once a week since. they are known for their chicken , whether you get the half Grecian or kabob or breast plates. I recommend the skirt steak."
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,M M.,"OH MY GOD!!! This place has the BEST chicken I've ever had! The food is super fresh and after sampling almost the entire menu, I'm addicted!! And...now they deliver to my work! Thanks to me and my big mouth my whole office is also now addicted! You are welcome everyone!!! PS...the cheese fries and Greek salad are amazing too!!! Super Clean and I think it's family run! LOVE!!!!!!"
stanleys-grill-chicago-2,Tiffany S.,I love this place... We frequent this spot every Saturday....  The cashiers  are always pleasant. And my fav cashier is Liz... when I call she always know our order.....
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Jq C.,"Looks nice and tasty but forgot to take the rice noodles soup, taste spicy very good for cold weather!!!"
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Alex R.,"Came in around 8pm on a nice summer Thursday night. The crowd was already winding down and by the time we got our food the place was mostly empty. Service was fine but the food was pretty meh, the tamago was pretty soggy and the tuna was kind of inedible. It tasted like it had been left out for a while. I couldn't finish that roll.

I've been to their Grand and Madison locations, which aren't my favorite but still solid sushi places. This must be their worst location. I wouldn't come back here."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Anuj S.,"Apparently this is a new location for butterfly. I thought the place was nice. It's not very big, but decent location. Not too surprised by the experience or food, because we go to butterfly often enough. Usually the one in the West Loop."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Clara S.,Not bad for takeout sushi! The fish quality and presentation was actually surprisingly fresh and tasty. I ordered the rainbow roll and seaweed salad -my go to's- and both were pretty on point. The seaweed salad was pretty hefty in size too! I was very satisfied with my take out meal from butterfly. My only complaint is the price! Pretty expensive for a more casual spot like this.
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Ashley S.,"I just moved in to the neighborhood so Im trying to check out where is good place for dining and also carry out order. I picked up food from here before but never dine-in. My boyfriend and I had late lunch here on last Friday. The restaurant was almost empty cuz it was 2PM. However the service was very slow. She seated us right away but took her so long to take the order. The food came pretty quick but I wasn't sure that it was the one that I ordered once she took ordered she never came and asked how the food was. Regardless I needed to flag her down and asked , she confirmed . Anyway out water was gone quickly cause of spiciness but our waitress didn't seem to notice that. I gave three stars only for the food. Two stars deducted from the service."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Melissa F.,"I am so disappointed! I have ordered from here before and have always been satisfied with my order.

However, the food was just not good. The red dragon roll was pretty much inedible. It tasted...old and dry. The fish didn't taste fishy, per se, but it didn't taste especially fresh or have much flavor at all. And the rice tasted purely of vinegar. I get that vinegar is part of sushi rice but there was no balance. (Also, it was super busy when I went, so wouldn't sushi be more fresh as a result??)

The one saving grace is bubble tea (green tea flavor). OMG it was insanely good. 

Despite great bubble tea, the sushi was pretty disgusting, so I'm not going to be as much of a devotee here as I'd be otherwise."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Dee M.,"I want to start this with we have been here many many times. The phrase fool me once same on you, fool me twice shame on me applies here. Every time we are here the service is awful. Our last time we were the ONLY table in the restaurant and we still had to get up to track down a server to order. Food is mediocre at best. My partner was served a spicy tuna roll that tasted sour, like it was spoiled and when we told them they didn't take it off the bill. We ordered pad Thai for the kids who are 3 and 5 years old and specifically asked if it was spicy and to make it not spicy. It came out so hot the adults were saying the spice was too much for them... again refused to take it off the bill. That's $20+ of food that was taken back that we were charged for. We ask for a manager and was also told they don't have one and the server is the only person for us to talk to.

We won't be back."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Miss W.,"This goes down as the WORST restaurant experience in my entire life. Came in on a Monday night to celebrate a birthday seated by the rudest hostess- ever. She reminded us three times that they're closing soon and I stated to her that according to Google, they are open until 10 PM. She claimed for some reason they were closing early that evening -complete lie. She rushed the order so much repeatedly, she completely offended me and my company who's birthday it was... for a bad miso soup and shittiest service ever I would fire this person ASAP. Not only did you have ZERO customers in your establishment, but you basically asked your only customers to leave-who came in on a birthday dinner! Horrible place would NEVER recommend-ever. Clearly we know why NO ONE was eating there to begin with! Get rid of this disgruntled bitch if you want any customers."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Robin R.,The sushi is fresh and fast order turnaround. They lose a star because sometimes the staff is a little standofish. I haven't had anything bad there. I usually order the Baby Eggrolls and a Philly roll or BBQ Pork fried rice.
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Sarah S.,"I went to Butterfly with a group of 13 and they were very accommodating to us, including splitting our check a million ways! 

With so many orders going in, meals were coming out at different times. So much so that one person was completely done and others hadn't even eaten yet. Not much can be done to avoid this though at a smaller restaurant like this. 

Some of the most beautiful sushi plating I've ever seen! All of my friends' makis were displayed wonderfully and even my nigiri had  very cool sauce decoration. 

I started with the gomae-ae and it was fine but I thought it was smothered a bit too heavily in the peanut sauce. As much as I love nuts (harhar), it was overkill, I also ordered nigiri - tamago (sweet egg), salmon and tuna - all of which was very fresh and just delicious. I gobbled it all down and it wasn't hard on my wallet at all. All in my party were pleased with their meals and their noodle dishes were so large that most had leftovers.

Service was great from start to finish, food was tasty start to finish, all in all a great experience at Butterfly Sushi."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Anna A.,"My go to thai place!! butterfly is amazing. I've only had good experiences here and the food is delicious, portions are large enough to share.. Service has never disappointed."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Aaron L.,Listen this isn't because the food is bad ! This is because there service is horrible every time I order they mess it up it's ridiculous ! If I where you i would go sit down and eat there otherwise they will mess up your order and screw it up in some way ! Get it together !
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Nicholette M.,"This has had to have been the worst experience I've had at a restaurant. I only have one star because I had to. I work in the industry and I would never treat my customers like this. I came to this restaurant a few months ago and everything was great. I came in tonight and the food tasted like it was cooked over a bonfire. So gross. The manager didn't even come to the table as we asked, we had to pay for cold sushi roll that was supposed to be warm, and burnt tasting cashew chicken. I will never return thanks for the horrible experience. 

I wish I would've gotten the managers name shame on me!"
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Martino H.,"This restaurant was recommended to me by a friend. It is one of her favorite sushi spots. The food was great, some of the best sushi I've had. The portions were quite sizable for to money, so the value was much greater than I expected. I recommend getting the free salad to share between two. We also got three special rolls and a few sashimi pieces, and was quite full after. The rolls were tightly packed, neat, easy to pick up with chopsticks, and the presentation was excellent. 

The location is BYOB and nearly all the tables seemed to have taken advantage. The seating was quite close with barely any space to move between table, let alone a private conversation. The tables are short enough to lean in to hear your partner clearly without having to shout. On my visit there was a loud party of young women that seemed to keep the noise level up, but I was inform by my friend that groups like that are usually recommended to go to the location on Grand due to its ability to accommodate large groups in its party rooms. 

Whomever is taking your order will depend on their level of understanding you clearly. I'm told ordering over the phone is a challenge but we'll worth the effort. Our food arrived quickly. For the size crowd, we received all of our courses near moments after fishing the prior. Our table was cleared quickly and the wait staff was very attentive. 

Based on the prices on the menu I knew this was not going to be a very expensive meal, relative to other sushi restaurants, but I was quite shocked at how little I paid for such an excellent meal. Three courses with tax and tip was just under $100. I will recommend this restaurant to others. I will be going back soon."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Daniel D.,"Great place! My wife and I are regulars at this BYOB spot and they never disappoint, The Sushi here is just ""OK"" but where they really shine is the Thai food. Panang and Red curry and spicy crazy noodles are some of our favorite dishes. Good sized potions and very reasonably priced. Definitely worthy of a place in the rotation."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Jessica D.,The sushi here is outstanding ! Surprisingly affordable and fresh. Has a relaxing and cozy ambiance.  Can't wait to go back! I'm salivating
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Ellen J.,"Butterfly was lovely. We made a reservation which was good for a Saturday night; they are busy. The food was delicious and not too expensive...my group got the miso soup, seaweed salad, thai roll, crazy noodles and some sushi. It was delicious. And, they are byob, which is always a plus. I'll be using them as my go-to Thai place from now on."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Vivian E.,"Good food, great prices, fast delivery! I alway order cashew chicken, spinach pot stickers and catfish dynamite is incredible."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Zach C.,"Solid, affordable Asian cuisine in a great neighborhood. For two large entrees (my wife went home with leftovers) we only spent $25 including tip. 

Ordered the Spicy Crazy Noodles and my wife had one of their curries. Our food arrived quickly, piping hot, and was excellent. The veggies in my dish tasted fresh and weren't overcooked. The meat in both of our dishes was tender and tasty. 

Service was prompt, efficient, and friendly. 

Only con of the place was the music playing. Their speaker set up sounded very cheap and fuzzy. Music choice was EDM, which sounded even worse than usual on the poor speakers. If the volume was lower, the music selection was less obnoxious, or they had a higher quality system, it would have been far less annoying."
butterfly-sushi-bar-and-thai-cuisine-chicago-3,Emily H.,"first of all, i just wanted to say that the service is great, we have no complaint on that. the environment is good, great for large  groups of people. and it is a bit dark and not loud, good for either couples or a group of friends. the reason i gave it an average rating is merely because the food here is very mediocre and not authentic

we came here thinking we can get both thai and sushi in one meal, but the pad thai and the curry we got are definitely not authentic. I don't mind food that's marketed as fusion instead of authentic, but the taste is very mediocre that i would not say it tasted amazing for fusion food standard either, as it is not really fusion, it is more geared towards authentic food, but not done authentically"
the-rice-table-chicago,Kimmie R.,"Ohhh geeez, this place is a rare gem. Their food is cooked to perfection! Sadly, they only do catering and you can only order each dish for 10 or more, but wait ...wait there's hope here.

1) Their dishes are reasonably priced. Beef that you want to savor every bite and pause to think about how you will feel when your plate is empty will only cost you $50 for 10 servings - that's cheap! The way the food tastes is not. 

2) If you have a family of three to five and you select two dishes they will range for 30-50 each. Your left overs will give you two or three very tasty meals per person, so that makes this an excellent special occasion treat for the average family.

3) They have Louisiana Creole food (yeah, where else do they use the word Creole besides Louisiana, I know), and Indonesian food both of which are hard to come by in Illinois or Indiana the two of them together gives this restaurant a special place in a foodies heart. 

Look you have to try this place. You won't be disappointed."
the-rice-table-chicago,E Y.,"I got catering from The Rice Table for an event at the University of Chicago to feed 35-40 people. Chris was really responsive and nice during our communication, and we got really tasty items from the Indonesian menu for our event for a reasonable price. It was a hit; everyone loved it, and I'm very glad The Rice Table could cater to us all the way in Hyde Park. I recommend this place for big and small events!"
the-rice-table-chicago,betty b.,"Having lived in the Netherlands for years, we've been seriously craving Indonesian food lately. The Dutch love their former colony's cuisine!! So I began researching, and serendipitously happened upon The Rice Table on Facebook -- announcing a pop-up Rijsttaffel dinner that very Saturday!! 
Well what a fabulous night it was... A charming location, gracious service, aaaamazing food, and BYOB to boot!! 
I highly recommend you follow them on FB and jump on the next dinner. 
Thank you Rice Table for the delicious culinary blast from our past. We'll be back!"
the-rice-table-chicago,Liz B.,"I gotta say, I was less than impressed with this The Rice Table dinner.  For starters, it was really, really warm outside the day I went and the room had no AC. Also, the room was so loud, I could not hear anyone at my table, making conversation really difficult.  Additionally, we all sat (sweating) for 45 minutes until any food came out.  There was no welcome or introduction or explanation of any of the courses.  And the food itself was just not great. But the worst part: the final course was mussels, and there were at least two closed mussels on the platter that was passed to me - and eating those could make you ill.  They should never have been served.  I skipped that course entirely. Was glad when it finally ended."
the-rice-table-chicago,Mary Ellen W.,"My husband and I went to an underground dinner hosted by a Rice Table tonight.  What an amazing meal!  It was the first time we'd eaten Indonesian food and we fell in love with it.  Our meal was delicious: interesting and layered with spicy, savory and sweet elements.

Jane, who owns the business with her son Chris (the chef), was a very gracious host.  She chatted with guests throughout the evening, and made the menu very accessible to us.  We look forward to dining with them again soon!"
the-rice-table-chicago,Maddi P.,"I had never even heard of The Rice Table until this year's Pitchfork Music Festival, where they were one of the venders. I don't usually expect much from festival food but WOW. It's been a while so I don't remember the exact name of the dish, but I ordered chicken skewers over rice -obviously- with peanut sauce and pickled vegetables. The chicken was cooked PERFECTLY, and the pickled vegetables were surprisingly fabulous. I live in the suburbs so I don't have the luxury of convenience to get to the actual location and full menu, but I can't WAIT until I can get back."
the-rice-table-chicago,Bill W.,"We're just leaving their pop-up event and it was a fantastic time. Delicious food that I've never had before, and a great time meeting new people (communal tables). We'll be back!"
the-rice-table-chicago,Taz S.,"I absolutely loved the intimacy of this communal dining in a private home like an underground dinner. BYOB. Wished I had brought beer instead of wine as the food is rather spicy. It was a different style from the rijstaffel that I had in Amsterdam years ago but it was an absolutely lovely experience. My daughter and I sat with another girl whose father was Dutch, and she raved about the authentic cuisine. I would definitely recommend it if you are adventuresome and like hot spicy food. Enjoy w cold beer!"
the-rice-table-chicago,Tom N.,"This is only my second Yelp review but I use it extensively.  

I was visiting Chicago this past weekend to see my best friend from college become a Dutch citizen (his mother's Dutch).  In order to help celebrate this very special moment in his life, I made a reservation at Vincent, which I had been to before and really enjoyed.

The day of the reservation, one of the staff from Vincent called to let me know that on the first Sunday of the month they hold a rijsttafel and wondered if I would still like to keep my reservation.  I said absolutely, always having wanted to try this aspect of Dutch/Indonesian cuisine and I thought my friend would be thrilled.

Well, we both were~!

I've traveled fairly extensively throughout SE Asia and am a member of the James Beard House in New York City, so I don't mess around when it comes to food.

Not only was everything incredibly fresh and well-spiced but also delicious.  I had the absolute best rendition of beef satay that I've ever encountered--which to me was thrilling.  Better still,  one of the owners of The Rice Table really went out of her way to explain each of the myriad dishes and to make sure we understood the tradition behind a rijsttafel, including the all you-can-eat aspect and the expectation that the guests should linger over the food and stay as long as they'd like.  She checked in on us a few times and could not have been more hospitable.

In short, a really great place and very much worth the price (I believe it was $55 per person).

I highly recommend.

T"
the-rice-table-chicago,Dan C.,"This is a review for the pop-up dinner, or Rijsttafel, that they put on at Vincent's restaurant once a month. Prior to Rickshaw Republic opening, this was the only place to eat Indonesian cuisine in Chicago, so my fiancee and I decided to go last year.

All I can say is that the experience was terrific. The food is unique, with a heavy emphasis on spice and heat, using flavors that you don't find in other south Asian cuisines. The owner of the Rice Table came around to every table during the meal to explain each of the 15 different items that were served. If you wanted more of something they brought it out for you. Everything was delicious, and I've been wanting to go back ever since.

For $45, it's a great value, and since the menu changes every month, it'll always be a different adventure each time."
the-rice-table-chicago,Marcel D.,"The Rice Table is NOT closed, they are a catering service with regular popup services and always have been. Visit their website for more details."
the-rice-table-chicago,M B.,"Delicious dinner last night--plenty of food, gracious service by all and so many interesting and varied flavors. We will be back!"
the-rice-table-chicago,Henry S.,"In the annals of the Chicago underground/pop up dining scene, The Rice Table has a unique story all its own.  So they are a catering company serving the community.  Then a prominent feature on Chicago Reader.  Then regular pop-ups at Sip.  Then a celebrated restauranteur's return with Bia for Mia went 'on hiatus' under mysterious circumstances.  And voila... you got The Rice Table @ Bia for Mia.       

For those unfamiliar, you can compare Indonesian to Thai, but with a whole different level of taste and spicing.  Some of my favorite dishes include the Gado Gado.   A simple salad of lightly boiled shredded cabbage, fried tofu, green beans, and cucumber tossed in a warm peanut sauce.  Ayam Rujak, a stew of chicken in spicy red coconut broth.  And then an interesting combination of Pisang Goreng, Spekkoek, and coconut-pandan ice cream.  A very decadent crispy fried banana topped with a ton of powdered sugar.  Matched by the equally decadent layered cake that is Spekkoek.  The coconut pandan ice cream provided a refreshing respite.  Just need to look past the mint green coloring.  

Why 3 stars?  The Rice Table is unique in its rarity.  It is good home cooking.  They are also just starting a monthly Rijsttafel, which could be a good introduction to Indonesian cooking.  There is no other option for Indonesian food in the city aside from The Rice Table... So be adventurous, check it out."
the-rice-table-chicago,Caity F.,"Here's the rundown:
-shrimp chips - free and addicting, good start
-frikadel daging pedis (deep fried beef and potato fritter stuffed in a jalapeno) - tasty but SPICY. we were warned, so definitely can't hold it against them.
-rendang daging - SUPPOSED to be tender beef in a coconut curry which sounded so good but the meat was very tough. absolutely dried out. this plate was just very sad looking. dried meat cubes in a barely there curry sauce.... sigh.
-babi panggang - bbq pork with garlic black bean sauce. the sauce in this dish was by far the highlight of the meal. it gave me a glimmer, a suggestion of how good this food could be. would love a bowl of rice with green beans, chopped pork, and a lot of that sauce! 
-sambal goreng buncis - green beans in coconut milk. We both enjoyed this side dish, but it wasn't anything special. would not have been worth the $6.50 price tag a la carte.

2 stars overall, 5 stars if they just brought me a jar of that garlic black bean sauce."
the-rice-table-chicago,Debby P.,"Tonight was my first experience with The Rice Table, a pop-up restaurant and catering company.  It was delicious and the service was warm and lovely. Chef Chris' mom was our server and she is a really interesting and charming person.  The food... oh the food... Sooo good. I especially loved the spicy eggplant, the yellow curry chicken, the stir fried noodles and the pork skewers but there was nothing I didn't like. We were there about 2.5 hours. They asked several times if we wanted seconds on things. Very generous. BYOB. We brought a pinot noir but I'd recommend either a cold crisp white or, if you like it, beer. We will be back!"
the-rice-table-chicago,Scott H.,"A wonderful evening of Rijstaffel and making new friends. The food was well prepared, with fresh delicious flavors and ingredients. Chef Chris' mother, our host and server, was gracious and engaging. I will be back - and must say, this rivaled the Rijstaffel I had in Amsterdam back in March."
the-rice-table-chicago,Marja S.,"I have been interested in the Rice table (Rijstaffel) for a while now and when some of my friends wanted to go out for Indonesian food, we agreed the pop up Rice Table was the place to try. Being Dutch Indonesian, I want the food to be authentic and to taste like the food I grew up on. The Rice Table was absolutely yummy. We all loved the well prepared dishes that were perfectly spiced and hot but not packing too much heat.  The serving amounts were just right (you could always ask for more, if needed) and the variety of dishes were very well balanced.  The terong balado, basically eggplant, tomato in a sambal base was killer. Rendang beef and braised chicken in a spicy coconut sauce, curried vegetables and tempe, etc all delicious. And to top off the meal, they served Spekkoek or multi layered spiced cake with a scope of vanilla ice cream kissed with cinnamon. I was in food heaven. 
Oh sambal, how I love thee."
the-rice-table-chicago,Khadijah L.,"changed prices for pop up restaurant as follows: $10 to $12 to $15 to $18 to $21 to a la carte. Now they're doing prix fixe dinner and gamelan for... $45!
meh. i've experienced better."
the-rice-table-chicago,Tammy L.,"My husband and I went to one of their dinners at Sip on Grand this week and the food was good, but the service was very spotty.  It was basically Indonesian home cooking...tofu with hot peppers, veggie curry, white rice, fried chicken, pork skewers and peanut sauce, prawn crackers and tempeh.  We got there very early and they weren't ready for us, which was totally cool.  I enjoyed hanging out in the front room of Sip for a few minutes.  They seated us in the back room, which is a very cool space (I hadn't been to Sip before).  We had brought a bottle of prosecco and we asked for an ice bucket, which they said they would bring but totally forgot about.  Oh well. 

After a few minutes they brought our plates of food, and after comparing the items with the menu, I realized that they had forgotten the tempeh, crackers, peanut sauce for my husband's skewers (I don't eat meat), and tofu on my husband's plate.  So, yeah.  The kitchen (which was under a tent outside, a pretty challenging situation I realize) and our server didn't realize that major parts of our meals were missing!  That being said, I really liked the tempeh a lot.  It was supposed to be sprinkled on the food, according to the other plates I saw go by.  $15 for the meal was ok, but I felt that it really should have been a few dollars since the quality is on par with a neighborhood ethnic restaurant--good, but nothing remarkable.  The servers clearly were not prepared to deal with all the people.  There are lots of kinks to work out!

We decided to pay an additional $4 and split the dessert and coffee pairing, which was 2 pieces of fried banana (hot and good) and a thousand-layer cake (pretty dense, but delicate since they were very thin slices).  

The people were friendly, but this operation just needs a lot more work.  $34 plus tip was pretty pricey for what it was.  I wouldn't mind going back, but I wouldn't make it a destination."
the-rice-table-chicago,Melissa M.,"They do their pop-up at Vincent now and it's very good. Lots of food, well-spiced, and authentic."
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Melanie S.,"My friends and I came here for New Year's Eve (it's BYOB)! We were a big group and were happy they took reservations in advance, since it's a small restaurant. My bf and I shared some dishes and we stuck to Thai dishes, rather than sushi. We got veggie potstickers and they were fresh and crispy, with a sweet dipping sauce. We shared Red Curry (with chicken) and Pad See Ew (with tofu) and I loved both of the dishes! The red curry was very spicy and flavorful awe had to order an extra rice to soak up all the sauce. The Pad See Ew was one of the best I've had in Chicago (I order it all the time)... it was juicy and sweet (see attached pic - makes me drool!). 

I'm usually skeptical when a restaurant says they're good at both Thai and Sushi, but I can say the Thai was awesome (I didn't try any sushi). The only downfall to the whole experience was that the service was pretty slow, but the food was worth the wait."
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Anuj S.,"Ordered from Kin last night for delivery through GrubHub. The delivery did take a really long time. They estimated 1 hour and took even more than that. I don't know if that's Kin or GH, but regardless. In terms of of the delivery experience, pretty much everything was there in the order - although I wish they had included some hot sauce or something.

Overall the food had a lot of potential, but I think it wasn't spicy enough for us. The pad ke mao was good and the red curry was also good. Those are my two staples whenever I try a place for the first time. Again both good, but I felt they were missing that kick. Definitely had good potential.

One cool thing - with the order was we got some free miso soup. Good stuff - good deal.

I think I'd have to give this place a try in-person where we can customize the order a bit better."
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Victoria Y.,"Real Rating: 3.5

Came here with a few friends on Friday at 6PM. We were the only ones in the restaurant at that time. This place is BYOB and they give you an ice bucket for your white wine. The food though, was pretty average.

We ordered:

Soft Shell Crab ($8): This came with two tiny crabs which is pretty overpriced. They definitely weren't each worth $4.

Takoyaki ($7): This was pretty decent, came with around 8 balls.

Beef Panang Curry ($12): Portions were small. The sauce was very liquid-y, not like the thick creamy sauce that I'm used to. Also didn't come with much vegetables in the dish.

Sunny Roll ($14): This was really good. A lot of flavors and textures going on.

Sexy Summer ($14): This was also tasty. The mango was a nice touch. Both rolls were pretty small (8 pieces) for $14.

TL;DR: Bring wine! Order sushi but skip the curry."
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Nerissa T.,"Got delivery from here two nights ago and we definitely had a feast between the two of us. The bf wanted sushi and I was feelin' Thai so we got the best of both worlds! Originally found this place on Grubhub and saw that it had high ratings for the food and delivery time so we gave it a shot.

We ordered the:
- Crab rangoons
- Summer roll
- Spicy salmon & avocado w/ crunch mono maki
- Philly mono maki
- Pad Thai w/ chicken
- Pad se ewe w/ beef

The entire order ended up being about $50 and we even had leftovers for the following day. As for the food, it was pretty good. I liked the spicy salmon & avocado rolls the most out of the three we ordered. Both noodle dishes were very enjoyable.

But I was amazed by how quick our food got here. We placed the order around 6:30 p.m. and it was here by 7! About 30-45 mins earlier than they had originally estimated so we were very pleased with that."
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Vanessa Y.,"UmmUUUmmmmMMummm. 

This place is just okay. The flavors are not bad, but the portions are small for the price, and everything. is. so. oily. I'd consider getting this again, but only if I was pretty desperate. And honestly I might be, because there isn't much thai food in the area."
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Stevo K.,"My girlfriend and I order from here all the time. Quick delivery. You get a free appetizer on orders over $20. Pad Thai, fried rice, spicy tuna roll, tuna tartare, egg rolls, are all fantastic. Looking forward to trying their Ramen in the future. I recommend to anyone in the area."
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Jenny G.,Yum! I ordered a delivery off of GH. I ordered three rolls - which were all amazing - but my favorite by far was the sweet potato tempura roll. I absolutely love that they put cream cheese in it!! My friend ordered the Pad Thai and loved it as well. Also highly recommend the Crab Rangoon
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Misty S.,"We came here for dinner before going to see a show nearby at the Vittum Theatre.  We were seated right way and service was fast, although not that friendly.  They had a great menu and the food was good.

Soft Shell Crab $7 - I'm used to getting soft shell crab battered and deep fried but these crabs were almost naked.  They were lightly battered and delicious!  Also at a great price point compared to other restaurants.

Yellow Curry with Chicken $9 - This yellow curry is not spicy and comes with meat, potato, carrots and a side of rice.  It was flavorful and creamy.

Rock & Roll Sushi Roll $13 - This roll has salmon, unagi, crab stick, avocado and cream cheese, lightly battered and deep fried.  It was tasty!  I thought there was just the right amount of cream cheese so that it wasn't overpowering.

Parking is free on Sunday on Milwaukee Ave.  On other days, you'll have to pay for street parking on one side of Milwaukee Ave.  There are free parking available on certain streets nearby.

kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Jayme H.,"Kin was my go-to Thai spot in Wicker Park/Noble Square. I dined in a couple times (yes, they are BYOB) but ordered pick-up most often. They were always reliable, on time, and I hardly ever had an issue with my order. I think maybe once they forgot about it but were super apologetic and offered to make it up to me for the wait.  

My favorite item was their basil-fried rice with tofu. The serving is enormous and usually left me with lunch the following day. It always included a generous helping of veggies and junks of tofu. It was packed with flavor and I loved the jalapeno thrown in there to add some spice. I would also get sushi every now and then. While I wouldn't say it's the best in the area, it certainly works on a lazy Monday night. When it comes to appetizers, I suggest the miso soup. It's just what you expect when you ask for miso soup, warm with some soft tofu and seaweed. The crab Rangoon was also one of my favorite items. It was always crispy and several come in each order, like 5-6. 

Thanks for always being consistent and there when I needed you Kin, much appreciated!"
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Itisha J.,"I don't mind giving this place a generous five star. This place has great options for vegetarians. Its got s great flavor to its dishes and they are fresh!

Great Thai tea and coffee.

The lunch special is fantastic. Can't beat it. 

Family owned and operated.

I'll be back many times"
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Sarah C.,"The pad thai was average. It was bland and did not have a great flavor. My bf did not enjoy it, however I thought it was okay. Overall, I will probably not be ordering from here again."
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Rodrigo P.,"We often frequent Kin, Ploy usually takes care of us and gives us the best reception.
At this point, everyone knows our name, and makes us feel like a partner.

The food is delicious, and BYOB, so we bring our favorite bottle of sake, and feast lime it's our last supper

The price point is vary fair"
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Mike W.,"Solid sushi spot! We came here on a bitterly cold day and had the restaurant to ourselves for a while as most orders were carry-out and delivery that day. BYOB is always a fun way to go out with friends without spending a fortune, and all of our sushi rolls were very good. My favorite was the Sumo roll - 10/10 would order it again. 

The one negative was that it was FREEZING cold inside the restaurant. I don't think their heat was working, and they had a couple space heaters out that weren't helping much."
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,I-Lin L.,"I guess this place is known for sushi, but I was a bit worried about the quality of the sushi in what looked like an ""Americanized"" place, so I went with the hot food when I came for a quick lunch before heading to the airport for my last visit to Chicago.  The staff also appeared to be Thai, so I thought perhaps the Thai portion of the menu might be more authentic than the Japanese portion?  

I went for the $8.95 Mini Lunch special menu, where you can choose an entree from the Fast Lunch menu and an appetizer.  I chose Pad Thai with chicken and the crab rangoon appetizer.  (Although they spelled it ""ragoon"" without the ""n"" on the menu...  which I found kind of weird.)  

The appetizer was really yummy.  I guess this is what I consider ""American-style"" Asian food, because I normally don't eat this kind of stuff anywhere else.  Decadent and rich cream cheese goodness sandwiched between layers of fried dough, with a sweet dipping sauce--this was everything you DON'T want to eat while on a diet, haha.  

I also tried the egg roll appetizer, which was okay.  There were a lot of glass noodles and veggie filling inside, but the wrap was still deep fried and served with the familiar sticky thick sweet sauce that you find in my so-called ""Americanized"" Asian cuisine.  

My pad thai with chicken was also okay.  I usually like pad thai for its plethora of flavors and textures--sweet, tangy, chewy, and crunchy--but this dish was somewhat off with the chicken not tasting very fresh.  :(  I dunno why the chicken tasted the way it did, but it kind of ruined the dish for me.  I still ate it though, because 1) I hate to waste food, and 2) it was still edible.

I also tried the mixed vegetables with beef, and it was kind of like a standard stir fry that I can make at home, so I usually don't order dishes like that when I'm out.  But it tasted fine with lots of lean beef and veggies, so I guess it was much healthier than the other stuff we were eating.  

The bathroom was small but had some cute modern touches, so I think they did a good job with sprucing it up.    

All-in-all, this is a good solid restaurant if you want some grubbage, but I wouldn't say the food is anything out of this world."
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Megan R.,"Would definitely eat here again. We had the shumai, takoyaki, negi hamachi roll, and gyoza, but the entire reason I'm writing this review is because of the takoyaki. Since traveling to Osaka I've been craving great takoyaki and striking out at most places, but the takoyaki here is excellent - the right texture and flavor. Highly recommend!"
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,J M.,This rating is solely on the Thai food. The atmosphere is nice and laid back. A good place to enjoy some sake. I tried the pad Thai with chicken and shrimp. The fish had no kick. Seemed to be closer to sweet. Even after adding chili to the fish it never made it any better. It will do for a Thai fix but I can't give it a great rating for the lack of flavor.
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Mercedes M.,"Great crab rangoons here! Perfect filling to wrapper ratio. I've only gotten the pineapple fried rice, but I enjoy their take on it. I would say it has maybe more of a masala/curry flavor to it but it's good! I usually get 2 meals out of an order."
kin-sushi-and-thai-cuisine-chicago,Trina K.,"Good stuff! 

We chose to stop in because my girlfriend who is vegan orders delivery from this place regularly and is a fan of their sweet potato rolls. Sweet potato aside, I was admittedly a little skeptical about eating sushi place at a restaurant offering both Thai and Japanese cuisine upon seeing their menu. Having eaten both Thai and Japanese items during our visit, I can truly say it was a welcomed and pleasant surprise. It was very, very good. And having eaten sushi the day before, I could fully appreciate the offerings here were without a doubt of a better quality.

d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Mark G.,"Let me preface this by saying I've never stepped foot inside this joint, so this review is based strictly on food and delivery. 

To think if it weren't for a night of being way too drunk and searching for any open and intriguing option on Grubhub, we'd probably have never tried DAGS otherwise. 

First impression was their thin crust is REALLY thin, which I've been a convert to the past few years. The sauce is tangy and has just a hint of sweetness, giving it a good balance, and their toppings are pretty generously applied and tasty. Much to our surprise, their other food is pretty good as well. Including the burgers and chicken parm, and beef sandwiches and salads.

I like that they have daily specials. E.g. Thursday their stuffed pizza (not as good as their thin, but not bad by any means) is 20% off, 2 free pizza toppings on Tuesdays, and a couple other ones. 

The only bad thing is sometimes they're a little jerky on the phone. But I can get passed it because they've literally never screwed up our order. Besides, I can order online and bypass any human contact whatsoever. Also, delivery times have never merited any complaints either. 

This is one of best late night drunk discoveries I can think of. Definitely a go-to when jonesing for that real thin crust."
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Julie B.,Nice small place and served strong drinks!!!  Food was good for a small bar. I wish I had tried the pizza but just ordered the chicken Parmesan which the chicken was over cooked.
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Lauren M.,"I was disappointed with not only the delivery but the management of this restaurant. After an error on their behalf, they would not give us our money back and only would issue a ""credit."" However, when we tried to redeem this credit we were hassled by the manager, Megan. We did not receive what we paid for and warn others of this as well. Do not forget they have a carry out charge on top of delivery and online ordering charges. This adds up significantly."
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Lisa R.,"I'm pretty surprised my some of the reviews. Maybe they were delivery related problems. I tend to dine in or carry out. Never have I had an issue.
I love their thin crust pizza. Dip it in some ranch.
Their stuffed pizza is better than some more known Chicago pizza spots. They don't skimp on the toppings.
They have good salads and wings. 
I've never had any of the entrees, so I can't speak on that.
They have daily dine in, delivery and carry out specials. 
They have coupon offers. 
Solid place and good service. 
Bartender makes me a hot toddy if I ask. Not many casual spots like this willing to do it. Extra points."
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Arturo C.,"I've passed their location on southport, off of Addison, many times regretfully--never stopping by. Upon moving to our new apartment around the corner to their location on Odgen, off of Chicago, we found our golden opportunity to try this place out. Their dine-in beer/appetizer/pizza specials, that rotate daily, are awesome; Their FOH and BOH staff are very friendly and accommodating. The website is very intuitive, literally making a pizza delivery/pickup a click away! Our go-to order is the thin crust pizza with pepperoni and sliced jalape√±os (very spicy)."
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Stephanie A.,"Unbelievably dirty inside! I ordered a take out Cesar salad and found a bug inside. Do not order from here!

*UPDATE* Adrianna also wouldn't give me a full refund for my salad order..."
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Colin W.,Never had a bad meal here. Thin or stuffed crust are phenomenal. Salad is also great! Will be coming back soon.
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Lydia W.,"Stopped in at a friend's recommendation. Upon entering we were greeted promptly. Our waiter was attentive and knew the menu well. 
Overall the food was pretty good. The Philly Cheesesteak was a bit too much bun for the meat, but it was super tasty. 
Prices were good. Within an acceptable range for the portion sizes. 
The downside was parking. You have to pay to park. Which isn't a huge problem for me, but might be a deal breaker for someone else."
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,H M.,"I had the chicken Vesuvio, which was a lunch special, and it was well seasoned and juicy. Unlike some regular Vesuvio I have had before, this is a boneless chicken breast with Vesuvio potatoes. A very good meal at a very good price!"
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Edgar F.,I only order here once a week as part of a group order through my work.  They never get the order right....NEVER.  Too much of a hassle.
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Chris P.,"This review is based on delivery only. We ordered pizza and the delivery guy brought the wrong pizza, we called the manager and I asked if we could just keep the pizza they brought since they delivered our pizza to someone else. The manager said no and made him go back to get our pizza from the people he delivered it to. I spoke to her and said how would I know if they opened or touched the pizza, they then called us and said it had been opened and did we want to place a new order!?!?!?! This was after waiting for over 1.5 hours. I asked why wouldnt they just let us keep the pizza they had delivered and she said it was the other customers pizza? Crazy poor management. So we wound up not having pizza and making dinner. Thanks"
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Blake M.,"Sat at the bar one day with a lovely server/bartender who also does beverage orders (saw some sales reps come to her directly). 

She was very nice, helpful, friendly, and I was on a lunch break, that's really all you can ask for. 

Here's where things go amiss. 

Her owner, and what seems to be manager too, likes to sit at the bar and plain yell, disrespect, and rudely speaks to customers on the phone. He doesn't get off his butt to seat customers, and yells for staff to do so while he chats with locals, and yells directions. He even says to them that he's not here to do there job for them. That's a horrible mentality. 

Pizza is fine. Server/bartender I had was great. This guy, who is the owner was a complete prick. Kinda chunky late thirties. Needs to treat his team better. 

Hope that nice server/bartender finds somewhere else to be appreciated. He's lucky to have her. She's a hard worker. Dirty blonde hair, always smiling."
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Josh K.,"I have been a delivery customer (via Grubhub) of this restaurant for many years, and they have always been one of my favorites. But I must offer a critical review this time of their Broasted Chicken. It used to be quite good a couple of years ago. But the last two times I ordered it, it was dry and hard. yuck. ""Broasted Chicken"" is a trade marked process (requiring special equipment) that is suppose to (and does, when properly managed) produce fried chicken that is moist on the inside, crunchy on the outside, and non-greasy. Well...something has gone wrong with the process at D'Agostino's. Maybe they need to replace their machine, or re-train the operators...but the 'broasted' product they have been putting out lately tastes like something from the Museum of Natural History that has been given a life restoring blast in the microwave!  
                                                                                                                                                    
For fried chicken in Chicago, stick with Harold's. You can't go wrong.                                     
                                                                                                                                                  
PS. D'Agostino's DOES still make some great food. Try the Meat lovers pizza (with chef recommended toppings). Still a winner."
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Kerry D.,"Had an awesome large cheese for dinner delivered to the house tonight, it tasted great! However we had an issue with the service and female manager when we called in this evening, which is really upsetting!

We had a flier on our door for a free delivery coupon over $20.  We purchased a large pizza online and placed the coupon code, which the computer accepted and charged the credit card.

When the delivery man came to the door we noticed our card was charged for $4 more than what we agreed to pay.  We never received a phone call from the restaurant, our card was just charged and nothing was said at the time of delivery. 

My husband noticed the higher price and said something to the driver, and he told us to call the restaurant.  Upon calling the female manager said that the total price without tax was not over $20 and would not accept the coupon.  There was no indication of that at the time of purchase and no one called us to authorize for $24 charge.

My husband said if he had known that he would have used the other coupon provided which was $15 with 2 toppings.  The manager did nothing to help the situation and said sorry you ordered a cheese pizza with no toppings, there is nothing that can be done.

My husband said that he wanted to then return the pizza because he never authorized the $24 charge.  The manager was quick to then offer a $3 refund for delivery.... we will see if this ever gets corrected, I will be checking my credit card statement daily regarding this situation.

We were planning on ordering from another pizza place but we remembered we had a coupon to this location.  This is very disappointing.


Update**

Had a conversation with a manager about my issue, he was very kind and asked me to try Dag's again and hope I had a better experience.

I ordered a pizza and mozz sticks for delivery, the driver came really fast and the food was hot. It was delicious and exactly what I ordered. Great service!"
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Katherine H.,"Wow. Don't use this pizza place for anything. Terrible customer service. Called to place an order for 10 pizzas for the second time. Asked to use check and the manager was extremely rude and refused to let us use a check. Then when I informed her we have done it before she said it wasn't in the system and she ""didn't have time"" to ask her boss if they would accept a check. I find it ridiculous with how much business we give them that she would deny a $300 order multiple times a month. Fire your Friday night female manager. She's terrible at her customer service."
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Chara B.,"I LOVE THIS PIZZA! 

I gotta tell you.. without fail.. the pizza comes out A1. We usually get double pepperoni (make sure you call and specify any additional toppings) sausage and jalapeno. I had gotten the giardinera from here before and it's overwhelmingly spicy (but that's just me personally). Again, I cannot stress enough that this pizza comes out amazing every time. LOVE. 

Also, the wings. The wings here are amazing. They are always on point with getting us the sauce that we need and delivering the wings naked (as preferred!) 

We order from here at least 3 times a month!"
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Stephanie L.,"Meh, I dont really like their pizza.  The deep crust is too doughy and flavorless.  The thin is good, but I prefer a good deep.

Its overpriced and not delish.

Meatballs tasted like frozen balls
Onion rings were chewy and super greasy

I wont be ordering from here again."
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Cory W.,"The food was great the service was stellar, my only issue was one of the servers didn't get everything that I had asked (lines from the bar, extra sauce) and he was watching me pull out my credit card and fill out my receipt. Weird."
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Lauren D.,"Horrible delivery service.  We're past delivery time, rude on phone ( Manager) a when I asked where order was and then delivered wrong beverage. Lots of pizza options in Chicago, do not order from here!"
d-agostinos-pizza-and-pub-chicago-3,Debby W.,"Just spent $ 55.65 on delivery. We ordered 2 Philly Sandwiches they were charred totally and inedible. When I called to let them know I was told they did not check the sandwich because it was wrapped and could not credit us for sandwiches. DO NOT ORDER, THEY REALLY ARE CHARRED TO A CRISP. Also ordered the baterred onion rings, oil was dripping as if we were eating a bottle of oil. We will never, ever order anything from them again. Very unhappy non-customer."
five-star-bar-chicago,Kristin F.,"One of my most frequented West Town spots. The food is what you would expect for an inexpensive bar food menu. The service is always good + the atmosphere is fun. 

A great, casual spot especially for watching games. Recommend the Wednesday wings!"
five-star-bar-chicago,Julie S.,"I had passed this place a few times, and the sign looked cool. Judging a restaurant by the sign or a book by the cover is always a good move, so my boyfriend and I stopped by for drinks and apps on a Friday night. 

The weather was a little chilly, but the aggressive punk rock music encouraged us to sit outside. The service was fine, the table was fine. We shared nachos and a salad, and they were also fine. The one highlight was a super fizzy whiskey cocktail on draft for $5. If you're stopping by, definitely try one of those!"
five-star-bar-chicago,Alex C.,"A friend who lives in the area brought us here for dinner.

It's a neighborhood bar that has mostly burgers and sandwiches along with a good selection of beer and whiskey. The atmosphere is cool, it's dive-y but has like an alternative style to it. Has limited outdoor seating and also $3 PBR drafts, select whiskey shots and other $5 house whiskey drinks. 

Not too many people in there at about 9:00 on a Friday, but I feel like at that time most people were eating as opposed to drinking. Noise level wasn't too bad but I feel like as the night went on the music and crowd got a little louder.

We both ordered burgers. I got the BBQ and my friend got the 5 star. Both were very good, but I didn't think it was amazing. I enjoyed the pretzel bun and pulled pork that was on mine. I thought it could have used a little more BBQ sauce but overall still good. It also came with a large pile of French fries which were also tasty. It is a $13 burger and I would say without the fries it would be way overpriced, but it was a lot of food and we were more than full afterwards so not a bad deal.

My only major qualm was with the service. I thought we asked for separate checks but the server put them on one. Our food and drinks were the exact same price so we gave her two cards to split it evenly. She returned to the table with a check and two cards that weren't ours and we immediately needed to rectify the situation. She mixed up someone else's cards/tab with ours and accidently charged a different $18 tab to my card in addition to the 50/50 split of our tab, but said that she voided the payment and it should show up as $0 on my bank statement. I'm going to have to wait a couple days to make sure the $18 disappears. I understand accidents happen and I can take an extra $18 hit for a few days, but I'm not sure how my card got mixed up with someone else's tab. The place was not busy, our check was super straightforward and if the cards somehow got mixed up I would've been happy to confirm which checks and cards belonged to our table if it prevented a mistake like this.

Good food but pretty serious service error that hopefully is corrected without issue."
five-star-bar-chicago,Kyle D.,"Overall: A great semi-dive bar with lots of good drink selections. A great addition to the neighborhood.

The good: Great beer and drink selection with a good variety of specials. They have some quality taps on hand. They also have a good food menu compared to other bars. I'm a big fan of the unique vibe they have, a mix between biker/dive/rocknroll and not too heavy on any of them. Oh, and a pool table! Good music too!

The not-so-good: Not much in terms of watching sports. Not a ton of TVs and the ones that do may not be playing any sports. That's about it really, just not a 5 star place, which is hard to do."
five-star-bar-chicago,Eric M.,"Perfect music, good service and very good prices. I wish they had a few more items on the menu but aside from that I enjoy coming here."
five-star-bar-chicago,Alex A.,"I love Sundays here. $5 Jamo shot with Miller High Life bottle. And all burgers, normally up to $13, are on special for $7...and that includes fries still amazingly! And the burgers are damn good too. I especially like the 1/2 pound ""Five Star"" with sunny side up egg, smoked bacon, cheddar and a side of buffalo sauce. The ""BBQ"" with pulled pork and crispy onions is tits too. Another day, as they seem to have specials on food and drink nearly daily, has cheap sliders. Their beef is seasoned up nice and has good grill taste. I'd venture to say it's better than Au Cheval's fatty/greasy/over salty burger, my interest in which wanes by the day. This is a true pub burger (my favorite kind!) here, no thin patties. 

I have yet to try em, but one bartender swears the chicken tenders are the best item here.

Mixed drinks are so-so, they've got a few on tap or made on the fly by the affable, mostly female from what I can tell, staff.

The interior is a giant curvy corner type bar and some plush booths to the left, high tops near the windows/sidewalk. Low lit, bathed in red currently for the winter season maybe, or maybe that's all the time, I forget. The bathroom wallpaper is phenomenal. Vintage pin-up photography. 

Five Star Bar's name may be a nod to what they hope they get on Yelp. From me, they certainly earn it!"
five-star-bar-chicago,Saiazi F.,I don't need to go into detail this place is great food is delicious great variety of beer!! If you're easy going and looking for good food and layback environment this is the spot. Three floyds gumballhead is on tap!!! My personal favorite so I love it.
five-star-bar-chicago,Anne D.,This bar is amazing. They have the best food and great service. We ordered and the food was delivered within 15 minutes. I spent NYE here. It was a lot of fun!
five-star-bar-chicago,Zain J.,"Racist bartenders. Racist bar. Racist management. I'm a white-passing Arab woman dating a black man. We paid for drinks and sat at the bar. We had a passionate conversation about racism in America and all of a sudden my black boyfriend was escorted out because we made ""other patrons uncomfortable."" When I tried to discuss the situation with the bartenders and manager, even the manager couldn't explain why my black boyfriend was being kicked out. The bartender said we were arguing, which was blatantly false. They did not bother to ask if I was ok to gauge the situation but instead they pretended to care for my safety. The answer was no, i was not arguing with my boyfriend but instead simply reaffirming their racist misconceptions of my black boyfriend. The bartender asked us to never visit again. I certainly won't be returning and I hope all ppl with consciouses don't either."
five-star-bar-chicago,Chante G.,"This is a nice chill spot to hang out with friends. The servers were friendly and attentive. They keep the menu pretty simple, I enjoy a bit more variety on the menu, but it seems to work for them. I had the veggie burger with goat (!) cheese that was absolutely delish! The pricing seemed a bit high for the food, but the food was tasty! They also had a pretty good variety of beers. Overall, a nice place for a drink with friends."
five-star-bar-chicago,Christopher B.,If you're looking for a bit more of a low key night - at least on the Friday we were there - and seeking sort of that hipster type feel then this might be a spot to check out. I was a bit disappointed about their lack of run selection but I also know where I was. The beer list was decent but not great. Otherwise they seemed to be stocked in nearly every other type of liquor.
five-star-bar-chicago,Alondra A.,"I've only been here on Wednesday's, 50 cent wings & 3.50 Dos XX tallboys!! Always come with a group of friends, 4-6. It's kinda hard to get a space for group, they have booths that sit 4 comfortably but we always squeeze 5-6. Usually little-moderate wait time for a booth/table, on Wednesday's. (**Update, is you go early [5ish] super easy to get a spot for a bigger group by th pool table area). They have others specials throughout the week which I will definitely check out. Turn around time for wings is super fast! The wings are DELICIOUS, nice & crispy, great flavor! Waiters are super nice & down to earth, very patient as well. They have a pool table you can use for $1."
five-star-bar-chicago,Brent W.,"I thought I'd reviewed this place ages ago but guess not. Well, i've only been here maybe a half dozen times and never had a bad experience. Never really noteworthy either. Until now. 

Ummmmm.....all together now, drum roll por favor......TACO TUESDAY.  

They are of the elusive crunchy hard shell variety which is also to say the American variety...ok, i just made that last part up.  Apart from T-Bell.wth.lol or making them at home, you really don't see crunchy tacos on Mexican menus and certainly not at an authentic Taquiria.  So it's nice every now again to find them and it was a good surprise here. 

An even BETTER surprise is the $1.50 price tag accompanying these bad boys...yep, went there.soz. 

They also serve up their house whiskey for $3 which after consuming prob one too many I can't recall the name. But it's hipster pseudo-wannabe-trendy so there's that.

I need to start coming here more often, they have a nice menu and even nicer specials.  The bar is cool and decor is funk, what more do you need?  Well if you do then the bartenders are v cool as well.

[X] Don't miss it."
five-star-bar-chicago,Josh E.,Great bar with solid burgers and a swell selection of beers on tap. Service from Stefan was terrific.
five-star-bar-chicago,Ken M.,"Never had a bad experience here, it has become a go to place! Great wings and nachos also good beer selection $3 pbr on draft can't be beat! Yes at the end of the day it is a bar not a 5 star restaurant. People complainnig about small things obviously aren't aware it's a dive bar.Great service,great food you can't ask for more."
five-star-bar-chicago,Kelly V.,It was 10 min to close and my cousin and I asked to take a shot of all things before we close and they asked us to leave. It wasn't even close but the time for the busy ones to close.
five-star-bar-chicago,Kate H.,"Came here to watch a football game-it's not really a sports bar vibe but it was near my friends' apartment so we just decided to go for it.  The food was good, I had the cheese curds and everyone else enjoyed theirs as well.  We went on a Sunday night so they had a burger special that was pretty good, and the brussel sprouts were pretty darn good (coming from someone who's not a huge fan).

The server was friendly and attentive, even though we sat there for an entire game.  The prices seemed pretty reasonable as well.  They didn't turn the sound on for the game (but again, they don't bill themselves as a sports bar, so I can't really fault them too much), and there's a definite hipster vibe (but hey, it's the Wicker Park area).  The place got much busier as the evening went on, which I found odd for a Sunday night.

Overall, it was good food for good prices.  I'd go back just for a drink/meal, just maybe not for a Sunday night sporting event."
five-star-bar-chicago,Peggy T.,"We live down the street, so we tend to frequent this bar often. I honestly love everything about this place but the music. Its a little punk rocky for me, but their service is great and food is delicious. If you're eating, I'd suggest their cheese curds, pretzel sticks or pork nachos for an appetizer. Their chicken sandwiches and Havana are delicious as well. They've got a pool table and a few outdoor spots to eat. Great local spot to visit!"
five-star-bar-chicago,Nora F.,Friday night was very chilll. His son a very laid back. Love the decor and the background music. I thought the burgers where okay but right after we eat we play a quick game of pool. Did a mention it is only $1 per game. Yass!!
five-star-bar-chicago,Megan B.,"It's probably my favorite local bar. Good beer, good grub, service is reliably on point. It's grungy enough to feel comfy but nice enough to swing by intentionally."
china-court-chicago,Jayme H.,"This place is the bomb! They make pretty damn good Americanized Chinese food. It's always delicious, always made to order, steaming hot when you pick it up, and just what you want when you make the decision to order Chinese for lunch or dinner. 

Now, I lived two doors down for almost 3 years and ordered food from here at least 2-3 times a month. So, I'm not kidding when I say they are consistent at offering great food. 

I'm a vegetarian and they have tons of veghead friendly options. You can get pretty much whatever you want with tofu. I almost always got the sesame tofu or the general tso tofu. Both are super duper yummy! They know how to make tofu just how I like it, crispy on the outside. I would usually get either miso soup or crab Rangoon as well. Both options were always good. There's something so comforting about getting exactly what you want. They're reliable and that's what kept me coming back time and time again."
china-court-chicago,Carolyn E.,"Do. Not. Order. Delivery. From. Here. 

We used to order here frequently but we had one terrible experience and now we will never order from here again.

Overall the food is pretty decent and reasonably priced.

Their delivery leaves something to be desired, the last time (and final) time we ordered from here we called 30 minutes after our food was supposed to arrive and were told that it was ""10 minutes away.""  As the food rounded being ""one hour late"" we called again only to be told that our food was ""10 minutes away.""  We waited yet another 30 minutes, 90 whole minutes after our food was supposed to arrive and called again... our food was still somehow ""10 minutes away"" and this time they were accurate this time.  It was only on the third call that any apology was offered, and it was an afterthought.  We asked for a refund after we discovered our very late food soggy and cold... and the restaurant refused and barely apologized because we ""accepted"" the food.  

So in summary, there are many Chinese restaurants in Chicago... most of them know how to deliver food and when they don't they know how to deliver adequate customer service. ORDER SOMEWHERE ELSE. (Mon Lung, perhaps?)"
china-court-chicago,Erik Y.,"This is a solid choice when you need good 'ol Americanized Chinese delivery. It's quick and relatively cheap with a low minimum and low delivery fee. 

For lunch today, I ordered the Kung Pao lunch special and a large eggdrop soup. The soup was great while the KP chicken was spicy (as requested). Total with delivery charge (before tip) was ~$14. 

ProTip: If you want your food to actually be spicy, order 'Very Spicy'. I've ordered just 'Spicy' in the past and it disappointed."
china-court-chicago,Amy C.,"This review is based on ordering for delivery.  I'll edit this when I actually try the food.  I waited an hour and ten minutes and called to try to figure out where my food was.  I was told ""the weather made it hard for delivery"". (It's barely raining).  I was told the driver would be here in 15 minutes.  It's been 20 minutes and I'm still waiting.  Total wait time so far:  An hour and 40 minutes!  Absolutely unacceptable!"
china-court-chicago,Teddy R.,"This is my favorite Chinese-American take-out place in the Wicker area. Everything is always good, been ordering here regularly for about 3 years and have yet to be disappointed."
china-court-chicago,Akshay D.,Underwhelming. The veggie delight dinner tasted like it came from a frozen bag. The general tso chicken was sugary when I ordered extra spicy. Hot and sour soup had no flavor. The fried rice and pan fried potatoes stickers were decent though.
china-court-chicago,Amy H.,"Just what we were looking for on a recent Sunday night. Huge, hot portions of tasty Chinese food. I can't believe we hadn't eaten here sooner. From the outside it's very inconspicuous and easy to miss, but inside I was pleasantly surprised by how clean it appeared to be. I also like that you can see the cook cooking and the entire kitchen. Service was fast and friendly. Our new go-to for Chinese."
china-court-chicago,Janet C.,"I would have given them 5 stars but I'm giving them 3 because they messed up my order (which I was very specific with) and took over an hour to deliver. Ordered the chow mein house special and got the chop suey house special. I specifically asked for sriracha sauce and got none upon delivery. Egg roll was ok. Since we waited for so long and were hungry we ate the food, which was yummy and hot. Good flavor and good portion (ordered large). Too bad it wasn't what we originally ordered."
china-court-chicago,Molly M.,"Was craving some Asian food and came across this little hole in the wall place just down the street from me. This is my kind of Chinese take-out restaurant ! The place looked like they were trying too hard to decorate and make it look ""nice"", which is what i like. They still had their Christmas decorations up. haha The lady that worked up front was this sweet little Asian girl that pronounced my name as ""morry"" 
I ordered the a house fried rice and a small sesame chicken and it tasted like the Chinese take out i used to get when i was younger when my parents didn't want to cook their own Chinese food ! This will be the new go to spot ! (:"
china-court-chicago,Alex B.,"1 Star because of pretty bad delivery service. Ordered delivery on New Years Day and it was our first time ordering from here. The food itself was pretty good but we had an AWFUL delivery experience. It arrived 40 minutes later than the estimate, it was freezing cold, and the order itself was incorrect (we had ordered General Tso chicken and Beef and Broccoli was delivered). When we called to check on the order the woman mentioned they were really busy but it was super disappointing as a customer."
china-court-chicago,Nicole H.,China court is my SPOT!! I love this place. You're average hole in the wall family owned and ran Chinese place. They cook their food right in front of you and it's always steaming hot. Price is reasonable for the portion size. I asked if the orange chicken was spicy and they said I don't have to get it spicy and they made it perfect for me.
china-court-chicago,Christina K.,"I like it. It is inexpensive and good. I love that I can easily order on my phone and pay with cash when they arrive. It was a good experience lasted us about that night and the  next morning. We couldn't finish it! I mean they have portions so it depends how much you eat. I would order from them again soon. Can't complain. Simple yummy Chinese food. And, it made us really full!"
china-court-chicago,Finley W.,"This is my go to Chinese in the city. Service is great and always fast, staff is always very friendly and their pricing is great. They often have deals that give you free food which is another bonus."
china-court-chicago,Jose M.,"Prices are decent... No drink with the lunch specials... My delivery came and my looks like someone ate half of my orange chicken... that, or they got stingy with it... you can be better guys!!"
china-court-chicago,Sasha T.,"China court is the spot/my go-to Chinese food place. This is where I came after school, where I opened college decision mail, etc. They have the best food (shout out to their lo-mein, fried rice, and udon) and such kind and friendly staff. Go here!"
china-court-chicago,Taylor W.,"I had actually just been talking about how I wanted to find a Chinese place when I stumbled upon China Court. There's plenty of nicer places, but I wanted somewhere that would just give me the cheap, quick takeout I wanted when I was feeling lazy. When I moved into my new apartment, I was pleasantly surprised to find this place right below me, and brought some take out back as my first new apartment meal. It's not out-of-this-world spectacular, but my Orange Chicken was hot and tasted fine. The food was ready fast, but I could tell it was still cooked to order and the lady who took my order was friendly. The interior isn't super nice, and while it looked clean, came across as a little dingy/dirty. But this is a great spot if you want some quick takeout on a night in."
china-court-chicago,Levi B.,"The food is amazing here!  We've only done delivery and they are fast and efficient.  

I've had the General Tso's tofu the first time and made me come back for more.  This time I tried the Sesame Tofu which is my new favorite. 

The tofu is crisp and the sauce ratio is perfect and the flavor is so good.  The portions are large and the price point is a great value. 

We've found our new favorite Chinese fix!"
china-court-chicago,Raelene W.,"I came upon this place from looking at yelp and highly recommend trying this place! Everything is incredibly fresh and prepared by people who know what they are doing. Save the frozen food for Panda Express! The service here is so kind and very helpful if you are unsure what you want to eat. The portions are a good size for the price. For a person who truly appreciates authentic Chinese food, I am so impressed. They also deliver!"
china-court-chicago,Anamaria H.,"Six words: the worst crab rangoon, okay dumplings 

I live just the next block over so I only go here out of convenience. Truly. The fried rice is good (it's hard to mess that up), their dumplings are okay, their egg roles are okay. What's not okay is their crab rangoon. It's been okay before but today it was just horrible. Worst crab rangoon I've ever had. It wasn't even filled with more than just a teensy bit of filling. It was mostly fried dough. Like its like they forgot to put crab rangoon inside it.

Will I order from here again? I don't know. According to a lady I met, who has lived down the street from here for years, either management or the chef has changed. And she's noticed a difference in quality. I'm new to the area so I can't tell. But this last takeout experience was very disappointing."
china-court-chicago,Brian P.,"I mean, so fast, so good and the price can't be beaten. HIGHLY reccomend this place to anyone looking for a decent chinese place!"
epic-burger-chicago-2,Troy M.,"The Ilead. War and Peace. Infinite Jest. From the moment authors were putting ink to the papyrus, the possibility of an epic has been within their grasp. I haven't read anything longer than a ""Ranger Rick"" magazine in 30 years, but I'd choose Epic Burger over Emily Bront√´ without hesitation.

I was introduced to Epic Burger a few years ago after a trip to the movies to see ""Trainwreck"". Blame it on the unsavory meal or the unsavory comedy of Amy Schumer, but the experience was wholly pedestrian. So disgruntled over the entire evening, my dining partner and I ended up quarreling and I almost stepped in front of a bus. Needless to say, when she suggested we return for a quick bite, I was as happy as coulrophobic with free tickets to the circus. But after me lately visit, perhaps I'll buy her that new knitted shawl she's been begging for, because her suggestion led to a wonderful meal.

Epic promises ""a more mindful burger"" at any of its eight Chicago area locations. All natural beef, plant based packaging and organics up the wazoo--you'll find it all here. They offer a Bite Club which allows member discounts and chances to earn free items. I'm even getting free fries next time just for signing up! Oddly, they don't accept cash. I'm not sure about checks, money orders, or pieces of silver...so to be on the safe side, just make sure to bring a credit card.

The Lincoln Park locale was buzzing on a mild Saturday afternoon. The above normal temps were bringing out burger-believers from the 'burbs to Bricktown. There was even a guy there wearing a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey. Talk about making the drive! Epic can be described as fast-casual. After ordering at the counter, you're given a number and the food is brought to your table with the speed of 10,000 stallions. 

My dining partner and I had planned to order a meal, but were informed that Epic no longer provides that option. As a result, we ordered an Epic Burger Classic, a Beyond Burger, a Chocolate Milkshake and Sweet Potato Fries. The Epic Burger Classic was the single patty option with Aged Cheddar, All Natural Bacon and Epic Sauce. Though the Epic Sauce was sparse and the bacon was a bit too ""fast-foodish,"" it was a very satisfying meal. I could have eaten more, so I'll plan to go for the double patty option along with a wheat bun next time. The Beyond Burger was introduced a few months back and is plant based (beets, potatoes, coconuts, bamboo, peas), high in protein and low in cholesterol. It doesn't taste quite like beef, but still ""one of the best veggie burgers ever"" according to my dining partner. She kept raving about how good it was and the minuscule bites I was able to pry from her grasp hit the spot for me as well. She also loved the organic ketchup and could taste the quality ingredients with every bite. The chocolate shake was basic, but delicious. A malt needs to be thick, dear reader, and this one delivers. Epic needs to have better straws on hand to handle it, but otherwise, it was what we were craving. The specialty shakes look scrumptious too, and will be enjoyed at a later date. The Sweet Potato Fries were on the thin and crunchy side, so I'm afraid we'll have to call those a miss.

And, okay, the fries were very meh, but it's the little things that Epic Burger does that makes it less of a big deal. What may be lacking in that sub-par fry can be made up with the underlying feeling that Epic Burger actually cares, or is at least good at making you think they do. You can pig out, or choose a healthier option that doesn't taste like garbage. You can get a fountain drink and refill it until your little heart is content instead of shelling out three bucks for a 12 ounce can. You can pay half of what you would fork over at other sit-down burger places around town and get something as good (DMK) or ten times at good (Burger Bar). You can eat there knowing that maybe I'm just chowing down on a burger and it's not going to fix the hole in the ozone layer, but at least I'm giving my money to a place that is doing SOMETHING tangible to make the planet a little cleaner. There's even a social component that asks you to hashtag your experience and wind up on the restaurant's dining room TV screen in real time. What kid (or adult for that matter) wouldn't love that? So I'll definitely be back and if the fries still aren't how I like them, then so what, I got a free coupon. I'm not coming here for the fries anyway.

Food: ****

Service: ****
Overall: ****"
epic-burger-chicago-2,Paulina N.,"I swear that's the only place I know that doesn't take cash! Isn't it ridiculous 
I've never waited longer for a milkshake to go. It took a lady 20 minutes to make it RIGHT in front of me, cause she was also chatting with some security guy and it felt like eternity!
After all I was really disappointed to find out it didn't even taste good! Well, I know I won't be coming here anymore. I am not supporting businesses that limit me and then perform a poor service with a meh quality."
epic-burger-chicago-2,Edward E.,"I ordered a double turkey burger with grilled onions lettuce tomato and pickle and I picked sauce. I also ordered an order of fries. There were a few people in the restaurant so there are plenty of tables open I got a nice cold glass of ice water complementary grab the plastic knife and fork and make sure I had organic catchup as I waited for my food.

The turkey burger came it was piping hot. The whole wheat bun was soft all the ingredients were fresh and everything tasted great and it was rather healthy compared to the beef hamburger. One thing I was rather unhappy about was the small amount of french fries that were given for the price paid it was a small amount of fries. They also could've been hotter as they were lukewarm. Overall the burger was delicious and for the price paid it was an OK deal. How are the fries were lackluster and given the price they were inadequate. 

The staff were friendly and efficient, the place was very clean and it was quiet. I appreciate the organic ketchup Heinz of course. Overall it was an average meal with a higher price tag. I might come back."
epic-burger-chicago-2,Ryan B.,"Not quite epic, but really darn good. The chain has been in Chicago for a while now and I finally just tried it out. In Chicago I'd still rather have Shake Shack but I wouldn't mind having Epic Burger again!"
epic-burger-chicago-2,Neal E.,"YES. PLEASE. 
^This is my response anytime someone asks me if i want to go to Epic Burger. Here's why: They have the Beyond Burger. it's a completely plant-based burger - perfect for veggies, vegans, and people looking to try something new. The best part: it's not awful, haha. It's actually the best non-meat burger I've ever had at a fast food chain! 

And for those that like meat, I hear the Epic Burger is not only ethically made, but lives up to its name ;)"
epic-burger-chicago-2,Henry T.,"I never feel guilty after eating here. I've been here a few times and their burger is really good. The edge is crispy and their epic sauce is pretty good. Griller onions too. They advertise how healthy their burger is and it doesn't taste like a overprocessed greasy rotten carcus of meat like the that place with the creepy king who advertises it as your way. Talk about a pushover monarch. Or that place with that creepy clown whose face turned white from all that meat bleach. Back to epic, their fries are a hit or miss. One visit they would be perfect and the next visit I would wonder if someone stole all their salt? Maybe they used it to salt the sidewalk cause it's snowing? They have mini donuts too! Try the powdered one, pretty good. Doesn't taste like the weird stuff you find at dunkin donuts. And get yourself a peanut butter shake if you can spare the calories."
epic-burger-chicago-2,Michael W.,Worst restaurant experience ever. The manager was the worst.  My family waited 20 min for turkey burgers and got beef. I ask to speak to the manager. I watched the guy go tell the manager and he just proceeded to keep doing what he was doing so after 5 min I walked over and was greeted with pure attitude. So I asked for a refund and took my family elsewhere. I'll never eat at any epic burger again
epic-burger-chicago-2,Anthony H.,I came to try a burger and it was delicious but shaquita  service was what made the experience over the top! She knew the menu I'm a big beef eater but she insisted that the turkey burger wouldn't let me down and it didn't! Epic sauce was a plus and I'm not a big sauce kind of guy! This spot is a must and have shaquita  hook yo ur burger up! I hope on speaker the name right! Lol
epic-burger-chicago-2,Garrett S.,"Update 11/17: I've just added another star. Someone from the restaurant reached out to me about my concerns and customer service like that is so rare and super appreciated. He explained how they source high quality ingredients and the price reflects that. No big. My original complaint about the flavor of the food still stands but based on their customer service, I'll give them another shot and update my review accordingly. Solid service goes a long way! 

Original review: Overpriced and under flavored. This is not a good burger. It doesn't taste like they salted the patties before cooking and the cheese was just bland. The fries weren't any better (albiet SLIGHTLY more salted). After a few bites, I decided to cut my losses and get a gyro down the street. I won't be coming back if I have the choice. A basic cheeseburger, fries and a fountain drink should NEVER cost more than $10 (my meal was $15). 

Bottom line is this: judge a burger joint by it's plain cheese burger. Small Chavel and DMK are great because they build interesting burgers on top of a well seasoned and delicious foundation. This place doesn't do even the most basic things well so I'm not going back."
epic-burger-chicago-2,Freddie L.,"Sink your teeth into a PLANT BURGER!  A couple of bites in, and the flavor was remarkably similar to a beef burger, with a somewhat softer texture. The patty got a nice crust from being seared on the flat grill, and with the seasoning it's hard to distinguish in flavor from a typical beef burger. Beyond burger is currently available at Chicago-chain Epic Burger. Its current price tag is around: $12 bucks with fries/sweet potato."
epic-burger-chicago-2,Giovanni B.,"What made this establishment likable was their simple menu: select burgers and shakes. How much simpler can you get? When ordering your burger you can choose which ingredients you want to compliment it. There are a variety of sides to choose from apart from fries. The classic milkshakes are delightful, but if you want to step it up a notch there are milkshakes to choose from apart from the classic vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry. The burgers are not only delicious, they are a healthier alternative for you being organic. I highly recommend this place."
epic-burger-chicago-2,Sarah S.,"I honestly love the food at Epic Burger, however something has recently changed. Every time I go there now and eat in at the restaurant my clothes STINKS like food. It's really bad and never used to be this way. I have had my coat airing out for 3 days now and it still SMELLS. They really need to get a new ventilation system or they changed oils. I will never dine in there again, so probably will never return now. This has happened the last 3xs I have been there and never before."
epic-burger-chicago-2,Reza K.,"My friend and I received a coupon for DePaul students to receive $4 burgers to relieve the stress of finals week.

We walked 20 mins to this store to try Epic Burger for the first time. When we got in, they were unaware of the promotion going on. I even showed them the flyer that I was handed out, but they still were unaware

I expected them to at least honor it since we came all that way to enjoy an Epic Burger, but instead they turned us away and wouldn't honor the coupon.

In an effort to save the store $2 per Burger, they ended up losing any opportunity of me going to an Epic Burger in the future.

epic-burger-chicago-2,Marianne G.,This was the worst burger I've ever had over cooked & full of grease... I recommend who ever wants to try Epic Burger forget it go someplace else...completely disappointed...OVER PRICED!!
epic-burger-chicago-2,Arlene G.,"definitely should NOT be called epic burger cuz these burgers were not epic at all. there was hardly any strong flavor or taste to them. I had regular beef burger on wheat with lettuce tomato ketchup mustard pickles & cooked onions on them. but if it wasn't for the toppings & condiments my burger wouldn't have had any real taste to it. the fries were lackluster too. plus I don't like fries with  the skin on them. im not a burger snob at all but I just wanted some spices added to my meat, is that too much to ask for?"
epic-burger-chicago-2,Tauseef S.,"Great organic, grass-fed, halal beef burgers. We ordered the double epic burger with all the goodies and it was delicious with the right amount of ""greasy"". Would certainly revisit again, and yes if you want to avoid the white wine in one of their sauces, just tell them so and they would give you the halal option of those sauces with no white wine. Great friendly service and nice sitting place too."
epic-burger-chicago-2,Sonia C.,"Great burger so much flavor and the shake was to die for. Henry really helped us out, gave us great customer service. Coming back for sure. Drove all the way from Indiana for this burger and the drive was very well worth it."
epic-burger-chicago-2,Varvar Y.,"Although we frequent this EPIC burger because we like the food, I suggest checking your bag before leaving if you are ordering food to go. We've gone home to find a missing item enough times to know this. Good luck!"
epic-burger-chicago-2,p g.,"I eat lunch here twice/week, rotating between the Beyond plant burger and the turkey burger.  Both are delicious.  Once you get used to the smell of the Beyond burger, you will start to crave it. Best vegan burger anywhere.  Love the fries but only eat them when I get free ones....definitely join the very generous Bite Club.  Lots of free stuff. Very friendly hard-working staff too and easy free parking!"
epic-burger-chicago-2,Gail G.,The cashier could hardly disguise her boredom...rude. The 70's called and they want Led Zeppelin back. It is overpriced. It appears sloppy and haphazard at the counter. I regret coming in here and will stick to 5 Guys from here on out.
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Kurt F.,"My wife and I only live less than a half mile from Iguana Cafe for over a year and we only have ordered delivery or take out about a dozen times but finally had the chance to dine in and loved it just as much as we LOVE the food!   The interior decor is very warm and comfortable and the wait staff were excellent

Now onto the food!   While we were not the biggest fans of the crab dip which is the only item we thought wad just okay, my wife is obsessed with their chicken caesar salads and i have always felt you really need to have a solid and unique taste for a general caesar salad to really stand out.  And i myself am OBSESSED with their pasta selections.   Unfortunately its so good that as much as i wish i could stop eating halfway and save a little bit of pasta heaven for later i continue to eat past the point of overeating and regret it later.   That last part was for sure a compliment FyI.  Most of the pasta selections are cooked and then baked.  This is really now the only way i cook my own pasta.   I have also heard their breakfast is amazing but we have yet to try that yet so looking forward to it!"
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Aanchal B.,"LOVE. One of my favorite dessert places in the city and was a go to spot in undergrad (right by UIC). The waffle and crepes are recommended and definitely filling! It's a good place to bring a date too because the lighting is low key and romantic. The ambience and decor is modernistic and there is an iguana cage but have never actually seen one so not sure what is up with that....

Service is a little slow but still giving five stars because the wait is worth it. I have heard the coffees give a good ""taste of Europe"" so will have to try that next time. Another plus is that there are outlets available and they are open late."
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Belle L.,"Reliably open. Hit/Miss.  Stay with European Basics - i.e. hot/cold frappe, bougatsa, tomato soup.

With today's coffee standards, $2.75 warm generic HOUSE BLEND COFFEE (1 refill only) is unacceptable. Have you seen Starbucks or Dunkin serve WARM COFFEE?  Server was confused why I wanted HOT COFFEE, so I suggested to microwave it.  Its the same cup with my lipstick on it, my guess... hot water was poured on existing coffee.

SKIP the flour tasting crepes.  Crepe color and feel says UNDERCOOKED.

CAUTION:   SUGGESTED GRATUITY on the receipt is based on TOTAL (with tax), NOT before tax!"
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Vidhi S.,"This is a cute cafe tucked away in the river west area. I came here for brunch on a Saturday, mostly because I was tempted by all the great Yelp pics of their dessert crepes. I ordered a cannoli crepe which was pretty good. It was stuffed with the cannoli filling quite generously. My friends ordered savory breakfast crepes which are huge portion sizes. I liked the dessert crepe but probably wouldn't order it again. I wanted to try something different so I opted for the cannoli crepe but realized that I prefer crepes with Nutella, fruits, etc. The prices here are very reasonable. I was able to find free street parking just a block away."
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Ndidi B.,"The carbonara is worth the hype. Almost told them to hold the bacon, but thank God I didn't. Napoli sandwich [sp?] was nothing extraordinary. Lava cake was tasty but not worth $9 bucks. Ambiance is relaxing and intimate, and I spotted the iguana cage but did not see the actual iguana. Maybe next time?"
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Tina C.,"Excellent European style cafe in the West Loop. The restaurant has a very relaxed and modern artistic ambience, and was not too busy around lunch time on a Sunday. The food came fairly quickly, perhaps about ten minutes.

The crepes - highly recommend! They are very fresh and they have such a wide selection. The  creamy caramel creations was such a treat, you must try it if you like caramel. The Venice was also very fresh and had a distinct taste of red peppers.

The Napolitan was an excellent carbonara dish, and is a good dish for sharing. They also had a special of an egg souffl√© which was delicious, as there was potato on the bottom and seemed quite gourmet. Overall, very high quality food and would recommend!"
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Julie K.,"I tried their Greek crepe, jalape√±o Mac and cheese, and white chocolate mocha. The crepe tasted great and was a big portion, though they could've distributed the big chunks of feta into smaller pieces. The jalape√±o Mac and cheese had a lot of jalape√±os to add a solid kick, but I thought the dish was lacking a flavorful cheese that could've added more depth. The white chocolate mocha was delicious, but tasted more like a caramel latte to me. 

The highlight was definitely the service though! The waitstaff was super attentive, and constantly refilled my water. 

We originally came here for lunch and to study, but there is only one outlet and the noise level can get pretty loud around lunch time, so I would suggest not treating this place as a cafe but more as a lunch or drink spot."
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Nirmal M.,"One star because of a policy they have to charge $5 for every non ordering customer. I went with four of my friends for dessert and we ordered two items and a cup of coffee and were to share. The server told us that we needed to order two more items to avoid the $10 charge. I asked to speak to the manager because it seemed crazy to me but he pointed me to their menu that clearly stated this (picture attached). We canceled our orders, finished the coffee and left. Don't go here expecting to share."
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Mustafa N.,"Smoked salmon was delicious, tuna sandwich was decent. Smoked salmon was the perfect amount of smoke, and had a good taste to it. Tuna sandwich was decent, tasted like a basic tuna sub."
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,H A.,Felt I was transported to a Europe . Nice little cafe spot . I went for brunch and had a savory and sweet crepe . Good crepe . Nice service .
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Tanya A.,"One of my fav cafes for coffee and/or food! Iguana cafe is located in river west area of downtown chicago and definitely offers a ""taste of Europe"" as they claim. I've tried their raspberry mocha, Nutella crepe, and jalape√±o cheese dip and all items have been delicious and leaving me wanting more. All items are reasonably priced which is a plus. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying more on the menu as the pasta dishes sound phenomenal! 

It does get quite busy during lunch hours, however, if you come in the morning or after lunch- there's tons of spots and availability. Lots of outlets as well and the wifi works great. I know some of the reviews say it's more of a sit down restaurant - which I agree, but the laid back vibe makes it a cool spot to get work done at as well.

Another big plus is the hours!!! They are open 7 am - 12 am which is unlike most coffee shops and they have a full bar so it definitely offers the best of both worlds."
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Helen C.,"The Pasta Carbonara (without green peppers) is to die for!!! The wine is priced very well (not many places in Chicago where you can get a decent brand nice sized glass of wine for under 10 bucks).  The service is consistently fantastic.  

I have to say that I have never had a bad experience here and I have been coming here about 12 times per year for 4 years. 

I highly recommend this place if you like good food, good service and good wine.  Two thumbs up here!!"
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Yuan C.,"A great place for coffee and brunch! This cafe is reminescent of coffee houses in Europe, very dimly lit with interesting decor. I ordered the raspberry mocha to start. I's absolutely delicious! There is a light fruity taste that isn't overpowering. Then we shared the carbonara pasta in clay pot. WOW this is amazing! The cheese is soooo melty and the pasta is super savory with the perfect amount of bacon bites. We devoured it within minutes! We also shared a savory crepe- we got the Lyon crepe. Since we just finished the carbonara pasta, we weren't feeling the cheese in the Lyon crepe very much. I'm sure if we had eaten the savory crepe before the pasta, it would've been a different story! 

The prices are very affordable. Service is great!"
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Emily W.,"Love this place! Hidden gem for sure. Delicious salads and crepes. Next time I want to try a sandwich. The coffee is incredible. The iced mocha latte is life changing, trust me. Wifi is reliable too and the waitstaff doesn't hover but are always nearby if you need something. Very friendly, relaxed neighborhood vibe. It honestly doesn't feel like you're in Chicago, it feels like a European cafe (which it is). I've gone about three times in the past week and I honestly can't get enough! Highly recommend for a weekend brunch or late afternoon boost."
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Asja D.,"A small Chicago hidden gem ! I was with my boyfriend and mom and we all wanted some late night coffee (around 7:00 pm). I couldn't find any small coffee shops within the downtown area (aside from Starbucks) that were opened late. I used the Yelp app to search for a late night coffee shop and surprisingly enough, Iguana Caf√© did not appear in my search! The only reason I ended up here is because I visited the place before and I remembered they have late hours of operation.  Whoever is reading this from Iguana Caf√©- please make sure to list this out as a Late Night Coffee place because if I didn't remember, I most certainly would have ended up at Starbucks. Anyways, it was my boyfriend's first time here- he was absolutely taken aback by the atmosphere.  Lighting is incredibly important in any setting, as it sets the tone of your restaurant. Iguana Caf√© is edgy yet romantic so their dimmed lighting is ideal for creating an intimate yet enjoyable experience. I can't recall if there are chandeliers but I do recall that every table had small plastic candles that really added flair to the table. The one thing I didn't like is that our server joined two round tables near the bathroom entrance and the main walkway as opposed to a more intimate corner. I had mentioned to them that we were coffee ""toasting"" a special occassion and I most certainly felt disregarded in that sense- if they wanted to, they could have placed us at a more intimate table. Not to mention, it was a tight squeeze, I could tell the people sitting behind me were annoyed by the distance between us as we were sitting down. The waiters had plenty of room to place us somewhere else but I hope this review will serve as a reminder that customer's seat preference (when seating is available) is extremely important to a great dining experience. The music was not extremely loud and you could actually hear the people you were with talk without screaming or shouting. I had a double shot cappuccino and my boyfriend had a strawberry smoothie and we shared a nutella, banana and strawberry crepe.  The crepe was so good- it had plenty of nutella, strawberry and banana. The crepe itself was cooked to perfection- not too thin but not too thick either with just the perfect serving size of nutella. I loved it! The cappuccino wasn't that fantastic- it had more foam than actual coffee- it may appear that you're getting a lot of coffee but then you realize it's just foam. I would go here again just to try the various other coffee selections available!"
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Jing L.,"Love this place! The food and service were very good here. My friends and I ordered the tropical pleasure waffle, the classic tempting trio crepe, and the spicy chicken wrap. They were all pretty good. 

It's a good place to have brunch, lunch and some cocktails. The atmosphere was also great, and prices were reasonable. Definitely try the Iguana Caf√© once."
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Annie S.,"Not a bad place for a date. Dessert crepes are the jam!

Been here twice now, once one a date (the veggie crepe, yessir) and most recently for a sweet bite with the man after dinner at the Dawson down the street. Service was a little slow, she seemed kinda ambivalent and then looked surprised when we asked for the check so soon. I dig the decor, although idk what the little shop area is in the front of the store. There's a tank above the bar area in the rear corner - what is it filled with?? Daresay an actual iguana?

Only 1 bathroom stall - must make for a huge line in such a small establishment."
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Brent W.,"I gotta admit, this place sorta kicks some arse in a Euro Chic-ish way. Love the look, feel and vibe of the place and the service was completely on point.  Excellent drinks, great sandwiches in generous portions with quality ingredients.  

The gf intro'd me and the boy to this place on that semi-nondescript stretch of Milwaukee Ave and we will def be back.  Check it!"
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Suzana G.,"Iguana Cafe is an ideal Europian Cafe with cozy charm and welcoming atmosphere. Their hot chocolate is to die for! Their sweet crapes are the main reason I try to visit Iguana Cafe as much as I can. Tempting Trio is my absolute favorite! Savory crapes are also delicious, however crape portions are pretty sizable. I cannot finish both a savory and sweet crape in one visit, so I try to be strategic about what to order. If I'm not too hungry I usually order hummus and fresh vegetables, followed by one of sweet crapes. Sweet crapes are a must for me each time I visit Iguana Cafe. I have to mention that their pastas are also delicious! Food prices as well as drink prices are more than affordable for a place this close to downtown Chicago!! I strongly suggest you visit Iguana Cafe next time you are in the area, you will not regret it!!!
PS. There is a live iguana in the built-in wall cage."
iguana-caf√©-chicago-2,Kelly M.,"This place is amazing. I always get the pasta carbonara!! I ordered it for delivery late one night because it was the only restaurant delivering and I fell in love. 

Definitely recommend! Try any of the pastas .. you can't go wrong!"
estate-chicago-5,Joanne D.,"This was a last minute night out adventure with old friends so we decided to check out Estate. Get there early because they do get busy and dress to impress. 

The staff was very friendly and got us in no problem. Valet is also available in the evening. Drinks are very responsibly priced compared to other places in the city. 

I love the rooftop it has an amazing view of the city that looks over the river. Great place to hangout with friends and catch up. 

I definitely would recommend this spot for a quick fix for your night out adventures !! Make sure to book your party in advance if you have a large group or get there early."
estate-chicago-5,M√≥nica V.,"I went here for a birthday celebration last night, and I've got some things to say.

~There was SUPER loud, almost deafening music playing, which was completely unnecessary for the small crowd of people there
~""Mandatory"" $4 coat check? Yeah, NOPE
~They have a rule that you can't wear jeans or gym shoes, fine. But I saw at least two people inside with jeans- enforce your garment rules if you're going to market yourself as some ""ultra"" bar
~My sister asked for a menu and was told there isn't one, even though I was able to find their menu online...
~The drinks we ordered were served in cheap plasticware
~The furniture in the our booth was damaged and uncomfortable 

Needless to say, I might not go back anytime soon."
estate-chicago-5,Big D.,"So, the organizers for my 20th year high school reunion chose this place to do a day party. I must say I was not disappointed in the least, this was the perfect spot. It's like a luxury patio on the water because his place right on the riverfront. And below the railing you can see people renting pontoon boats to go out on to the water and enjoy summery days.

The staff was great, very accommodating and held good conversation. The space is very open and comfortable, and this place really lights up at night, very chill atmosphere. Multiple spaces available around the facility so they can host multiple parties at the same time and you don't have to overwhelm each other with the same type of music. I would definitely look to this place for an option and throwing a private yet large event, this establishment would make it very memorable. Look forward to going back."
estate-chicago-5,Greg G.,"Place seems pretty sketchy to me. Hopefully the police and victims family will find justice from this tragedy. Thoughts and prayers with the victim's family.

estate-chicago-5,Sophia H.,"LOVED IT! Had awesome music, awesome staff. And I love that they are open until 5am. Def a place to hit.

I decided to have everyone meet here for my birthday and I had such a blast. I got greeted with a shots and the music had us dancing all night. Pepe, one of the promoters, was nothing but great! He made sure my group and I were having the time of our lives. Definitely a night to remember (:"
estate-chicago-5,Ed D.,I only went here to hang out and didn't eat anything.  Really nothing special except the view of the skyline at night from the rooftop.  It's a good place to take a date after dinner to just hang out.  They had a DJ and with a cool breeze from the river and a nice warm night it's gives some pretty neat ambiance to have a good time.  It wasn't packed and the clientele were nicely dressed.  Plus no entrance fee so I will definitely stop by again whenever I just want to hang out with some of my peeps or a date.
estate-chicago-5,Maribel S.,"This club is lame!!! We came from California to have a good time and it took us over 30 minutes to get in the club. Keep in mind this was in 20 degree weather. Ridiculous!!!! We asked the security guard to have some mercy on us as we are Californians and his reply was ""the line is moving"". Still took another half an hour to get in. I don't understand what is so exclusive about this place but won't be coming back. You don't make your people stand in line for over an hour in 20 degree weather. That's just cruel!"
estate-chicago-5,Julian I.,"Pretty cool view on the rooftop. Other than that, pretty crappy service. Friend of mine had a birthday with the option of getting wristbands for $40 so we did. Only could get drinks from the downstairs bar which was somewhat annoying but, I guess it's something you have to live with. 

The most annoying part though was later that night. A friend and I went up to the bar to get some drinks (which by the way, was super packed. Not enough bar tenders in my opinion) and after about 20 mins, a guy finally notices us. We put in the order and as he was about to start our order, looks at our wrists and says ""oh I'll be right back."" He then went on to serve other people. Terrible service to say the least."
estate-chicago-5,Vinny C.,Over priced on drinks $12 for makers mark and club soda wtf? $8 Max and $12 for a shot fuck that. this place is wack location is dope but the times I been here it's been dead.  Fix ur prices on drinks.
estate-chicago-5,Jonathan T.,"This place sucks. They had barely any bartenders to cover the work load. Asked for a madouri sour, bartender said ""there's 700 people in here, order something normal""

Another bartender told me they couldn't make an Irish car bomb, and then another one told me they were out of cranberry..... are you kidding me? 

T R A S H"
estate-chicago-5,Jennifer B.,"This is a way overdue review. Even before ROOFTOPS were the thing, me and my girlfriend checked this out for happy hour (2010 maybe?), I have always forgotten to write a review, so here goes: Workers here were not friendly and the decor was lacking upstairs, food was decent and they had some decent drinks as well...

don't come here to impress your out of town friends as the view isn't the chicago has to offer and the service...not impressive either."
estate-chicago-5,Raul B.,"The view of the city skyline is incredible from the estate rooftop. Another incredible thing that this establishment has is the amount of underage patrons that are allowed in and are served (liquor). Security staff is not properly trained and fail to check patrons for IDs or weapons. A friend of mine walked in (unintentionally) with a gun on his lower back and security didn't even do a body check on him. In addition, the valet drivers too are untrained. They can't handle cars with proper care. For example, two pedestrians were crossing the main road (elston) meanwhile the valet driver almost ran them over while driving my car. Management needs to manage this place better or the city will shit this place down in a heart beat."
estate-chicago-5,Carl S.,I have never been disrespected by a business like I was Saturday. Me and my girl were waiting in line forever while we watched countless people enter the club. I confronted one the men outside ( I don't know if he was management or the owner) but he would ignore me. I have a business and I would never treat people waiting to spend there money with me like that. I will never go back to that place.
estate-chicago-5,Lalo G.,"This place is very over rated. Definitely a nice view but the security is very extra. No need to wait 45 minutes plus to get in. There are way more nice roof tops in the city to go to. To the security, get over yourselves and let people in."
estate-chicago-5,Jay L.,I have been to Estate twice and both times I was overcharged for drinks. Today I was charged $17 for a Corona draft and the last time I was there I was charged $12 for a drink that was listed on the menu as $6. I talked to a manager and they were extremely rude and unprofessional. I decided to give this place a second chance today and I instantly regretted it. I will never come back to this place. It's a total rip off.
estate-chicago-5,noah s.,"Really like this venue. Good music, hip-hop and Latin music. We went on a Thursday night it was a great time."
estate-chicago-5,Little D.,"There is NOTHING ""ultra"" about this dump. I went here for the first time tonight and was charged $10 for a WELL vodka tonic!  I guess that was the ""ultra""... the pricing.  This was also served to me by a bartender who seemed to believe that she was doing me some type of favor because she had to do her job. There are no locks on the women's bathroom stalls on the rooftop and the bathroom was absolutely filthy and disgusting.  No itemized bill for our table, either.  This place is tragic and no one in my party will be back. Horrible."
estate-chicago-5,Ammanuel Melaku A.,Psst! Looking for a reggae night while enjoying a breathtaking view of the Chicago skyline. Estate (on Wednsdays) is your go-to spot. Good music. Good people. Great vibe.
estate-chicago-5,Kathleen I.,"I just had a party at Estate Ultra Bar, and I couldn't be more impressed with the beautiful view from the upstairs Star Deck, nor with the great staff, who work there, especially Adam, who really did everything he could to make the evening special for everyone attending.  I would highly recommend Estate Ultra Bar's Star Deck for a great evening party!"
estate-chicago-5,Allison R.,"This place was absolutely terrible. From the moment we got there and ordered a drink at the bar, the bartender who was about in his 40s was so rude and a smart ass when we asked questions about what was included in our $40 wrist bands. The entire staff lacks professionalism. Everyone was so stuck up. I will never ever go back even though the roof top looks like a good time during the summer. This place needs a reality check and should probably be on bar rescue and let Jon Taffer show them hospitality skills!"
arts-drive-in-chicago,A B.,"I stopped in this morning for a quick breakfast and I am glad I did.  This is certainly a bare-bones type of place but for a quick and tasty bite I will be back!  Here are some relevant details:

- Pancakes - yum!  Better than expected for this kind of joint.
- Sausage and bacon were good quality, again better than expected.
- Staff were nice!
- All the seating in this place is stools with no backs, which works for the in and out but not the kind of place you will want to hang out for an extended time (though they did have a nice TV showing the football game of the day.)
- Parking spots available out front - very handy.
- They do catering - and very affordable catering at that.  I will remember this place next time I want to feed a lot of people for a reasonable price."
arts-drive-in-chicago,Frank Q.,"At the corner of this awful intersection is a great little place to eat some Chicago classics.  Art's Drive In is worth a stop for anyone in the area looking for a good hotdog and some fries.  I had a hot dog (no hot peppers) and some fries.  The service was polite and quick.  The hot dog was tasty, and had that satisfying ""snap"" when you bite into it.  The fries were crinkly and crunchy ... excellent.  The table salt is Greek - nice touch!  The crowd is mixed, lots of ""deese"" and ""doze"" type guys, but also suits/ties and jeans crowd.  Parking can be a bit tricky, but worth it.  I've had the same thing twice, each excellent.  Next time, I'll try more from the menu."
arts-drive-in-chicago,Fred M.,Wow. Just ate the skirt steak with two eggs straight up. Of course the steak medium rare. Cooked to Perfection probably in my top 5 best pieces of steak ever eaten. You would never think driving past North Avenue and Elston you can get such a great steak for breakfast. Nice job Arts Drive In keep up the great work
arts-drive-in-chicago,Othoniel C.,"I CANNOT believe I never thought to step into this joint (for almost 40yrs) until this morning! There's NOTHING fancy about this place or it's menu, but if you're hungry stop on in (seriously, make sure you're hungry). All I had was a ham and cheese omelette, grits, hash browns and coffee, I paid half the price than at the last place I went to (and reviewed) for breakfast and I ate twice the food! And yes, it tasted great!!!"
arts-drive-in-chicago,Victoria R.,I always get the Art's 2x2x2x2 but the best part about his place is the ppl ! The food is always going to be good but the ppl make it 10x better
arts-drive-in-chicago,Kristopher S.,"Food delivery is consistently at least 30 min later than estimated time.
Last 3 times my eggs have been broken,slide to the side and under stuff, or once they were out the side of the container. If I wanted scrambled eggs that is what I would have ordered. I am done with this place."
arts-drive-in-chicago,Leang E.,"This is one of my boyfriend's favorite restaurants in the city. He always gets the steak here. I have had a few items and they are really tasty and hearty. Most recently, I had the vegetable soup and the turkey and bacon club. Both were flavorful and delicious. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't as greasy as I thought it would be. The staff is really nice. The prices are reasonable as well. I can imagine how busy they could be if it had a lot of seating but mostly standing room and 2 tables."
arts-drive-in-chicago,Pete K.,"The employees are very kind, it's a mom and pop kinda of place. Great service, they talk to you as if somehow they know you are a human,  weird lol. The skirt steak is fantastic, cooked to order, and the bread is perfect. Toasted, crisp, light, fluffy and hearty all at the same time. It may be expensive, but damn is it worth it if you like steak. Coffee is exceptional, as in its really good f'in coffee. Their pancakes, bacon, and eggs will fill the most hearty eater up and are everything you will want to start the day off right. 

The tell tale sign that this place is really good is the loads of hard working construction men and women that eat here every day. If you've ever labored you know how meaningful breakfast or lunch is and this place nails it. Ohh, and their fries are delicious, crisp, large, not oily, but just perfect. I can't vouch for all of their food choices because honestly I'm so pleased with what I order why change it. Try this place out, and seriously, skirt steak,  have I mentioned this enough!"
arts-drive-in-chicago,Gerry X.,"Been a loooooooong time since I been here, and I only stopped because i didn't frequent the area as much....this place has been here 14 years, and the food is awesome.  Skirt Steak, Italian Beef (in my own opinion) The Art Burger, and the Rib-eye steak.  Good stuff man.

Shakes are good, and the owners are friendly.  This place does do delivery (it out sources it) and they have a lot, but it is small, and on the corner.  SO careful coming in or out of it.  But otherwise it is pretty awesome.  Try the frappe shakes.

Also mind the hours....my friend had breakfast here and he loved it, but he is open pretty early, so I think he closes by 6 pm."
arts-drive-in-chicago,David B.,"Awesome place! Plenty of room and large windows to sit down and chow down the amazing grub and Not feel trapped. Tried the cheeseburger, it was great , came back today and tried the art'a burger, pretzel bun with a special cheese, and a huge party, simply destroyed this thing :) great place, fast food, and great service.

Will be back!"
arts-drive-in-chicago,Leah W.,"I wouldn't recommend going here if you're on a diet, but if you're in the mood for some old school greasy-spoon hedonism, this is a good spot to scarf down some calories!

Oddly enough, this place does not have, and never had, a drive in - something I confirmed with the manager.  I always assumed it did, just driving by, so imagine my surprise when I pulled up and there was no entry.  Luckily I have legs, so I got out, went inside, and got myself lunch.

I had the patty melt and fries. The prices were affordable and the food was fast.  The fries were very good, perfectly fried and not greasy.  The patty melt was good too; the burger was obviously not recently grilled, but what do you expect for $6 bucks?  All in all, it was fresher and tastier than fast food, and they were also super friendly and nice."
arts-drive-in-chicago,Adam J.,"Maybe  it was a bad day. Maybe it was the wrong menu choice. 

I was doing business on the northside and was craving grease. I saw the sign and pulled right in. 

The menu was expansive, but almost to the point of being busy and too much to visually handle. I saw an 8oz patty melt was on special, so I went for it. 

Now I must say, the crinkle cut fries were perfect. Perfectly golden  with just the right amount of salt and on the well-done side of crispy. Outstanding 

The patty melt was not good. The burger was maybe 6oz when pre-cooked. It had the consistency and size of a McD's quarter pounder without any of the taste.  However, the rye was pretty good. 

I now understand that the skirt steak is the thing to get here. And if I come here again,I'll give it a whirl. But in my experience, the burger quality here is little more than dog food"
arts-drive-in-chicago,Justin B.,"Solid, average diner food.  Did the Art's 2x2x2 this morning (pancakes, bacon, eggs), and for $5, this was plenty of food.  The pancakes were rich, buttery, and the store-bought syrup worked very well for me.  Eggs were cooked just right and the bacon was way too crispy.  The decor is as divey as a place like this should be, but with Choppers or Hollywood closer to my Bucktown home, it's hard to imagine a repeat visit."
arts-drive-in-chicago,Jorge P.,"People need to relax, it's a diner, not a 5 star restaurant,  and for what it is, it's pretty dam good and yes the thing to get is the skirt stake. Super friendly people, fast service, and great prices."
arts-drive-in-chicago,Janet S.,"Delicious place! They have the best breakfast and coffee. My favorite lunch sandwich is the chicken sandwich on pita bread! The best,, John is super cool and down to earth! Always has a smile on his face and his dad as well!"
arts-drive-in-chicago,Adrien D.,"I order off of Eat24 from these guys, and the delivery charge indicated $0.  I decided to order from them and give the delivery guy a good tip.  Food came, and I was handed a different bill with a $5 delivery charge.  Eat 24 still charged me, gave me $5 coupon, and told me the manager of Art's added the charge.  I called him and ask to explain, and when I told him this was unacceptable, he didn't apologize and then cursed at me.  I guess when you order $#%T food, you get $#%T service.  Food was okay."
arts-drive-in-chicago,An I.,"I had never been to this place but I stopped to pick up an offer for a friend.  The grease smell hit me coming through the door. Older dude behind the counter was rude, he mistakenly took the order to be ""five"" instead of ""fried""- and actually expected me to pay for his own mistake and wanted to argue with me, smh this was my FIRST & LAST visit!"
arts-drive-in-chicago,Stephanie S.,"The best. Fast, courteous delivery. The food is super cheap and delicious. So far I've tried the cheese fries, fish sandwich, chicken kabob plate, egg and cheese sandwich and garden salad. All were so good, especially the egg and cheese sandwich - which is quite a feat given that it's just eggs, american cheese and a french roll - and the cheese fries. Everything is really, really flavorful and tastes like good quality food, which is super impressive considering the prices. Btw - they do healthy food well too. I got the garden salad for $2.95 expecting crappy brown lettuce and some pale tomatoes, and got a huge, beautiful salad with ripe tomatoes, cucumbers, onions and hardboiled eggs. Highly recommend Art's for really good food at ridiculously cheap prices."
arts-drive-in-chicago,Dereald M.,"Check out the Daily Special meal for something delicious.

I love this place. I'm addicted to the gyros. The pita is always soft and fluffy, the meat isn't dry and the sauce is tasty. I love that I can get a slice of American cheese and giardiniera peppers on it without strange stares.

For breakfast 2+2+2+2 (The four deuces) is my favorite. Two pancakes, two eggs, two sausage and two bacon. Yummy

I've tried to eat my way around the menu, skirt steak, hot dogs, kabobs and chicken. But, do yourself a favor and ask John to build you a double fish sandwich with cheese and onion. Yes, I said onion. It's not on the menu, but the flavors are so yummy. But be ready to take a nap afterwards."
arts-drive-in-chicago,Ed A.,"Good Dog, but $4.35 for a dog, no fries, and a small coke at a hotdog ""dive"" is a too much. Go 2 blocks down the Home Depot and get as good a dog for 1/2 the cost."
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Irene S.,"If you love Bari, try Fiore. You're going to get what you seek ( great quality Italian stuff) and you're probably not going to get any stellar produce or regularly priced dry goods like bottled dressing or boxed dinners. The difference is the sandwiches are better, the meats are dirt cheap and there are no lines ever in my experience. 

I used to live kitty-corner to Bari and became a sworn disciple but after my first egg and pepper sandwich from Fiore (and a new home location) I am sworn to a new flag. The egg and pepper is stupid good, great for hangovers and even better if you know you've got a long day ahead of you. The Italian and everything else is awesome, I think they use the same D'Amato breads, I know they sell their delicious focaccia (YUM!)

Grocery items (dry goods) are typical for a bodega but expect less traditional American crap like ranch dressing or american cheese or boxed mac and cheese. They have some bread but not a lot. Some household stuff, cigarettes and feminine products for a steep price. C'est la vie if you don't plan ahead and run out!

The produce is about the same as Bari (i.e. emergency stop only) and I find that the sliced meats are much less expensive; in fact, I would say that it's the best deal for prosciutto di Parma that I've found and the nice gentlemen treat it with care, they aren't snotty when you specify how you would like it sliced. I wish that they carried Di San Daniele prosciutto and they don't have quite the variety of salumi and all that Bari offers but they have GREAT frozen pastas that we frequently purchase. 

They have beautiful pastries for sale and some frozen tiramisu and the like. Tiramisu was pretty good, I would definitely buy again. 

The crowning jewel of our last visit was a purchase of their house made Italian Beef! It was perfect! Sliced so thin and very tender, with complimentary au jus. We bought rolls, took home our bounty and made the most bangingest cheesy ultra dipped beefs. Heaven!

In other words, hie thee to Fiore. This place rules. Plus you can buy gross but delicious drinks like Brisk Iced Tea, my kryptonite."
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Lisa H.,"i'm staying in this area-i could never afford to live here.  it's changed so much that i hardly recognize it.  it's hard to find excellent reasonable local food that does leave you with empty pockets.  

i stopped in yesterday and got a basic turkey pastrami sandwich with giardinera.  i loved the giardinera a lot and was wondering if they were open on sunday mornings.  

they were.  i couldnt make up my mind. should i return?
then i read one of the reviews.

""if you don like it get the f***k are here! And go somewhere else."" To which I responded, this is how you treat your costumer also neighbor? ""I don't give a f***k"" he said.

of course i had to go back.  this is what all businesses really want to say to these privileged rich yelpers who can't even spell.  

i make pizza and pesto all of the time.  i got everything i needed and then some.

then i asked a really stupid question.

""is the pepper & egg sandwich good?""

joey the clown & other mobsters used to live close.  i'm sure they have had their share of pepper and egg sandwiches.

i ordered my very first one and fell in love.  i'll be back for their home made gelato.

bravissimo!!!  long live the old school italian deli."
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Shannon C.,This place is wonderful however please know the hours of operation are a guideline. The are rarely open at the scheduled time and often close early. The subs are fantastic!
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,S R.,"Used to go to support my neighborhood deli but the quality has gone way down. This is what they consider a $8.00 mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwich. Poor Oliver ate more for his dinner.

Update: Went back and ordered three different sandwiches and all were great! Hoping maybe I went on a bad day before? I will be back at this neighborhood deli."
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Josh R.,"Stopped in to have one of their delicious Italian subs, purchased it and an ice tea and went out to their patio to enjoy it there.
Got up to go and the red metal lawn chair was stuck to my clothing, looked and I had red paint all over my new shorts on also on my shirt.
Went in to tell the guy at the cash register what had happened, ............. he didn't seem very concerned that his furniture had ruined my clothing. In fact he didn't even apologize, barely looked at me and kinda said give us a call if it doesn't wash out.
Well you tell me, what kind of red spray paint washes off clothing?
If the fucking chairs are still wet and tacky why wouldn't you put a sign on them saying so, or even better yet close the patio.
They really didn't give a shit, also seems to be how they treat most customers that they don't already know.
Just avoid this place and their attitude."
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Mark O.,"Great neighborhood corner shop. The sandwiches are great, and everything else is nice to have at arm's length when you're not in the mood to cook after dinner. All is well priced, and they make a classic Italian style sub sandwich that rivals the best. 

It's a Chicagoan's dream of mine to live near a classic Italian sub joint and now my dreams have come true, and the reality exceeds expectations. 

Cheers to you Fiore's. Keep on doing the good mans work."
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Jose C.,"I came here and ordered their pepper and egg sandwich. I've definitely had way better from numerous places. What I did like about this place is that they make it fresh. I ordered it with cheese and hot peppers, but couldn't really tasty any cheese. Although they made it fresh, I felt it still lacked flavor and wasn't the tastiest I've tried. I do however like that it's small and in a neighborhood. I'll prob try a sandwich next time."
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Joel B.,"One of the better sandwiches and pastas I've had in a while. Very fresh bread, meat was great as well. Small little shop on the corner, loved the feel, friendly staff."
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Zach V.,"Great sandwiches and Italian specialties, bargain prices."
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Molly M.,"Phone call, 3:15:
Me: Hi can I place an order for pickup?
Fiores: No we close at 3.
Me: Oh okay, your website says 4 pm.
Fiores: I know that.  (Hangs up.) 

Better way to go about that...but the food is damn good."
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Carlos G.,"Yesterday I just had the worst costumer experience at this place in of the guys was really disrespectful also told me and I quote ""if you don like it get the f***k are here! And go somewhere else."" To which I responded, this is how you treat your costumer also neighbor? ""I don't give a f***k"" he said."
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Justin B.,"While this wasn't the Bari killer I was hoping for, it's a damn fine place to eat a sub sammie.

Came by yesterday and did the meatball and the Italian, and split these with my wife.  Fantastic, great prices, clean storefront (even at Bari, I don't love standing inside the place), and a little patio out back that has four small tables so in the summer sun, you can take this puppy out back and make a mercy killing.

I need to go back to both Bari and Fontano's to settle this debate once and for all!"
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Kyle S.,"If only there was a place as classic, good and cheap as Fiore's on every corner of this dang city. The subs are simple, tasty, not too heavy. Tucked inside of the neighborhood in Ukranian Village, the opposite of overwhelming spots deeper in West Town. They have all kinds of handmade stuff in the freezer as well. Come on guys, the ""rude"" service is part of the charm! At least it's quick!"
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Kim C.,"Love it. Great subs, they're ready for pick up 5 mins after I call in. Much better than vinnie's or bari's IMO. The lady and teen that ring me up are always very nice, she's especially pleasant. I never had the grumpy guy - I guess I've just been lucky."
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Andrea S.,Great sandwiches but bad customer service. Was denied a public restroom after spending extensive amounts of money in this store.
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Corey K.,Go to spot in UKV for real Italian subs.
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Lucy T.,"Great sandwiches, small selection of groceries, and they do awesome catering platters!"
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,KB C.,"Had an Italian 10"" sub...very happy with the outcome, good meat/cheese and the bread (d'amoto) was good too.  

I generally hit Bari as it's been my go to for years/ but Fiore is blocks away from our new home so that's worth a lot of future visits to further explore their other offerings."
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Beth N.,"I've resisted ever getting a yelp account because frankly, I think it can be misused. In the case of Fiores this one star is completely deserving.  The owner is the most dry and emotionless person.  He barely looks up from the counter or acknowledges his customers, and when he does it's snappy, and short tempered.  I've had multiple experiences with this guy, but figure maybe he's having a bad day or just doesn't care.  That's cool, I don't expect a song or dance for spending my money, but I also don't like to be made to feel like crap either.  In a day and age with technology and delivery access,  one would think a small deli/grocery business would be eager to provide old school manners to their customers and keep that tradition alive.  *On a positive note, not sure if guy who makes the sandwiches with tattoos still works there, but he was always very kind.*"
fiore-delicatessen-chicago,Kara H.,"DELICIOUS. Was at a friends place in Ukranian Village & we brought these in for lunch for a group of 10. Every single person was happy with their order. I got the smoked turkey which was fantastic. Note that the large sandwich is LARGE. Some of the other fan favorites were the combo & the meatball sub.

This place also delivers, and apparently has amazing breakfast sandwiches- those are next on my list to try!"
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Renee J.,"I had my first Corner Farmacy sandwich today and it was by far the best sandwich I've ever had and I've eaten quite a few in my life!
Healthy, fresh, superb quality, vegetarian friendly options. 
Find out where this truck will be next and go there, now!"
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Kirk P.,"The veggie club was tasty, but considering the sandwich alone was $13 and took 15 minutes to make, I was expecting a masterpiece. It wasn't."
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Mike L.,"Deeeeeee-liciousness. They live up to the hype. Fresh ingredients and great combination of components of lunch sandwiches. I usually try food trucks once and don't come back, because they are just grease-mobiles (mobile deep fryers). But there are a few that serve up real, fresh food. Add this one to that list.

I had their bacon/date and turkey club.  Both just great. Right balance of produce and meat/aioli. Great job, chef. And don't listen to those impatient folks: take your time and do exactly what you've been doing! It works! I can wait a few more minutes."
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,maurice s.,"Mise en place: how does it work? 
 
Today, they were at a festival beginning at 1pm. At 1:30pm, I ordered a veg sandwich, and they said it would take at least 15 minutes...to make A SANDWICH. 
 
I guess they needed more time to bake the bread and pick the vegetables, because they were shocked and indignant that somebody wanted to eat lunch that day."
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Matt R.,"Kick ass!

Corner farmacy does not mess around. They're not exclusively at 324 n leavitt, but a review is a review. They're basically ""everywhere"", or in my case at Lasalle and Adams. How can you not be awesome making food like that? Meanwhile, food itself is top notch.

Bacon date panini is just as awesome as it sounds. If you love bacon wrapped dates, the twist here is that it's simply better and more of a semi similar combination. Except, in a panini with feta.  My stomach is happy, although my wallet is crying for the costs of food trucks. C'est la vie, with great food like this. 

Definitely worth a visit. These guys have a good rep for a good reason - options are awesome."
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Simon S.,"Great healthy options downtown Chicago!  If you see the truck, it's meant to be and you MUST STOP.  Sandwiches, salads and cold pressed juices all using fresh local produce. You can taste the difference! Friendliest service from food service, they remember your name!"
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,John R.,"Food was great but overpriced. I would give it a five star rating on food alone but the one star is because this food truck clearly violates the ordinances by parking in a tow zone and staying over 2 hours. Since they violate these ordinances how do I know they do not violate health code ordinances? Doubt I would ever spend money at this place again. One star. Not going to risk my health with these reckless people.

If they start to be a little more considerate of the public and comply with all ordinances I would consider buying from them again."
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Maggie D.,"The Corner Farmacy is by far the best food truck I've eaten at in Chicago. The friendly service is impeccable & hard to match. I absolutely loved the asparagus panini - amazing lemon aoli! I appreciate that you can get any sandwich on a bed of lettuce or quinoa, too. The veggie burger with pesto is another favorite staple. Washing all this down with their green or beet juices is the only way to go!"
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Matt F.,This is hands down the best food in the entire city!!! The blueberry muffins are so good I risk parking tickets every week to get some!!! The eggs and pesto sandwiches are filling and Laura's awesome!!!!
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Elle N.,"Best food truck I've had in Chicago hands down. Amazing sandwiches, both breakfast & lunch. Good options for vegetarians & meat eaters. Their eggplant bacon is amazing!"
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Kate P.,"Awesome truck!  Love it!  Really good food.  Ridiculously good food from a truck.  

They were giving out samples of popcorn (amazing flavor, just enough heat), granola (didn't try), almond bar (lightly flavored delicious cake).  

I tried the Goat breakfast sandwich.  It was so fresh and so flavorful, thick bacon, hearty bread, peach rosemary preserves.  I saw the kale salad and it looked so amazing and colorful and I will try that next time."
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Rigopoula A.,"I've eaten pretty much everything off their menu at this point. I love that they change menu items with the seasons so I never get tired of what they have. Except The Goat, which they haven't changed and I'm still not tired of.

Can these guys open a storefront already??  Only downside is that I have to wait outside (winter is coming) for the food but it's soooo worth it.

I also appreciate that my lunch money actually gets me something quality unlike most places in the loop. Wow, a sandwich with enough fixins to keep me full? A lunch option that includes VEGETABLES? 

Lastly, the people in the truck are great. They make a point to remember you if you're a regular and always make friendly conversation."
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Ashley G.,"Corner Farmacy is one of a kind!! The sandwiches are top notch which makes it impossible to choose a favorite.  Bruschetta grilled cheese, veggie burger, asparagus sandwich.....all so good!! The Corner Farmacy gang is always helpful and knowledgeable about the products they are serving, this truck is a MUST have bfast and lunch spot!"
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Shreya L.,"Cute idea, the owners are very nice and friendly. 

I had a coconut milk-based pumpkin-mushroom soup. It was delicious, but it cost SEVEN DOLLARS. No soup should cost that much. I also wasn't told how much it cost until the transaction went through. 

Not going back. Pretty disappointed."
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Erin S.,"I've been to the truck twice now and really enjoyed the food both times - but the service is slow, even as food trucks go. I stood right at the counter for about 5 minutes before I could even order. Then two people who ordered several minutes after me both got their food before I did. $12 is also pretty pricey for a grilled cheese you need to give up your lunch hour for.

That said, the balsamic reduction was delish and the ingredients were clearly nice and fresh. The tomatoes tasted just like the ones I get from my CSA! And the people working the truck seem like a cool bunch. I can definitely appreciate that the hustle is real and that local does cost a little more, but I hope they can find a way to streamline their process or it will be hard to come here more regularly."
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Valerie D.,"Amazing breakfast sandwiches.  Especially the ""Goat"" and ""Caprese"" but the pumpkin breakfast cake is amazing! !!!"
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Kim J.,"I couldn't be happier with the service and food from the Corner Farmacy Food Truck. They are simply amazing. The ingredients are super fresh, local and of the season. You can't go wrong with any of the menu choices and wish the vibe being very casual classy, they are perfect for any event. I hired them for my recent wedding and everyone absolutely loved the food. It was a highlight of our event. Thank you Emily!"
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Tony D.,This place is my go to on Fridays for lunch.  They are the best in Chicago.  Great food and great people.  Goat cheese bacon panini sandwich is my favorite!
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Nathan E.,"I'm a bit of a basic breakfast sandwich connoisseur. It's my go-to: egg, cheese, bacon on bread. Anytime I find a new place that offers one, I'll usually try it. Corner Farmacy's The Classic is good, but not the best for its competition, and a little higher on the cost-side. That being said, I don't think you'd be disappointed in stopping here. I give my first stop here a 4/5 on the following factors. 

+1 Super friendly service (no really). 
+1 I had ""The Classic"" straight-up (i.e. no sauce/relish/etc.) Bacon, Egg, Cheese, on Sourdough. The cheese was amazing (I don't normally comment on cheese being the most noteworthy thing about a breakfast sandwich). It really was the best part of the sandwich.

+0 Sourdough bread was nothing to write home about, but not bad. Passable, possibly even decent, but for a $6 breakfast sandwich, I expect a little more omg-factor. 

-0.2 I'm super picky about my bacon. It should tear, not crumble or break. But this is a personal preference, and some people like crunchy bacon. But even so, the bacon was not the star of the sandwich, which is strange for ""The Classic"". 
-1 A little on the slow side. But ""good things take time"", right? As I walked up, one person was finishing their order. They took my order momentarily, and then I waited about 6 minutes for just a basic breakfast sandwich. 

For what you get, and how it's priced, it's an appropriate value. For a $4 sandwich, I don't expect much. For $6 I expect quite a bit more, and I think it's almost there. If the service weren't so notably friendly, I think it'd be a much tougher sell. There are better, more-expensive sandwiches, but also worse-but-cheaper sandwiches within easy walking distance of where I found this truck (Adams/Wacker). 

If I had a suggestion to them, going along with the friendly setup, I'd have appreciated a ""How do you like your bacon? Floppy or Crispy?"" Had they gotten this right, this would be a solid 5/5."
the-corner-farmacy-chicago,Kelsie L.,"Oh. My. Goodness. 

I just finished eating The Magic Mushroom sandwich and it was the most amazing thing I've eaten in a long time. You need to order this sandwich! The truck staff was really friendly and I'll definitely be back."
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Emily W.,"Ordered food for pickup through yelp. It was ready within 30 minutes. Everything was pretty good. Nothing too crazy/special but would order from here again. 

I ordered the vegetable egg rolls, garden vegetable roll, and spicy crunchy crab roll. All were decent. The vegetable egg roll came with 2 in an order with a creamy dipping sauce. FYI- They were pretty small. The garden roll had an interesting variety of vegetables in it and the spicy crunchy crab roll was on point."
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Kasumi B.,"Yelp note: 7% cashback!

I didn't feel like splurging on fancy rolls, so I went with the ""simple"" ones:
Philadelphia roll
Spicy tuna roll
Tekka maki (tuna)
Cucumber roll

I got sushi to go, and while I was waiting, they offered me drinks which I declined. How nice of them. I looked around and saw that they won Grub Hub's best spicy tuna award. Good, that's what I ordered!

My favorite was probably the spicy tuna, and fish in the tuna roll and philly were pretty high quality too. All of my rolls were above or under $5 so I say this place is totally worth it!"
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Kat A.,"I ordered carry out. When I came to pick up the sushi, the lady was waiting for me to get there so she could put the final touches on one of my sushi rolls so it would be fresh...how nice is that??

I ordered a spicy tako roll and the dynamite roll.  They were both small rolls so I was surprised that I ate both before I felt full.  There wasn't much octopus in the tako roll.  They were both just ok.  Not my favorite place for sushi."
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Austin B.,"Sushi was excellent, menu had both traditional and unique options. Very much what you would expect from a solid BYOB sushi option in Chicago.

The best part of the dinning experience was sitting outside and enjoying a full moon floating next to the  Willis tower from a distance. Highly recommend."
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Giselle J.,The sushi was mediocre. The biggest problem of this restaurant is that they don't shovel. How can they be so inconsiderate and indifferent?! I hope you can find my review and clean up your sidewalk.
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Anne B.,"I had great sushi dinner with my girlfriends.
Green turtle roll was amazing, salmon, tuna, hamachi, super white tuna sushi was very fresh. 
New master sushi chef is doing great job !
We will be back next week again : )"
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Jesus S.,This place is awesome and the rolls are quite tasty. The menu items like the fried rice is a must as well.
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Jessie Elizabeth J.,"This has been my favorite sushi spot in Chicago because of the quality, price, and atmosphere. The rolls are creative and use a good amount of fresh ingredients, and the space is intimate yet modern. As is the nature of sushi restaurants in Chicago, after a few visits the quality has gone down, and I really want the best for this spot as it's great sushi!

 I do have some suggestions for management-

when we bring wine because of your BYOB policy, please do not awkwardly point out you now carry wine and insist we buy something off your new list instead of acknowledging and accepting we already brought wine as soon as we are seated. You said you are going to impose a corking fee soon and that's fine, but insisting we buy wine when we clearly came with wine and being visibly upset we brought wine made us uncomfortable. 

 Also, my friend ordered the tonkatsu ramen and we were first clearly served a miso ramen-the broth was watery and plain. Instead of acknowledging this the hostess/owner nervously insisted the ramen was ""japan-style"" and grudgingly took the ramen away and replaced it with another bowl which was thicker with miso but just as plain. I KNOW this was not tonkatsu(pork bone/fat) ramen because we took some home and it did not thicken or solidify once refrigerated!!! And the wasabi balls we were served with the sushi were dried out on the outside and clearly pre-made and stuck in a fridge for some time before being served. 

Finally, when we told the hostess/owner we had a groupon she became upset and told us that they have discontinued using groupon, that groupon is making more money off itself than she is, and that the groupon is only for new customers. She kept asking us when we purchased the groupon and despite showing her the groupon expires months from now she was reluctant to use it. However she did eventually cave and I think ultimately the owners are just unaware of using social media and technology and would benefit from better knowing their customer base and focusing on customer service."
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Alexandra H.,"Very good!!! We had salmon sushi, dragon maki, green turtle, Chicago fire, fire cracker, and miso soup. It was all phenomenal! Very fresh! Will be making this my regular sushi spot!"
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Belle L.,"Neighborhood place.  No trek necessary.  Ordinary menu.  Lunch specials and Bento Box are better value.

Dine-in customers get cucumber salad and orange for dessert.

WHITE SWAN ROLL ($12.95) -- a tad heavy on sauce.  I thought it was good value due to ingredients Soft shell crab, cucumber, topped escolar, and jalapeno mayo sauce.

SASHIMI (2 pcs per order) -- decent thickness, quality and portion.

SERVICE and VENUE -- clean and decent."
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Sunshine M.,"I just ordered a snow crab roll and a dynamite roll from here.  Be aware that their Snow Crab roll is made out of imitation crab.   As a matter of fact, all the rolls with crab in it is imitation.  Will never order here again.  Customer service was horrible. Couldn't even rectify the problem by giving credit for the rolls which was falsely advertised."
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Alisa C.,Ordered delivery via UberEats. The order seemed like a waste of money since the Sunshine signature roll tasted like nothing but propane. The description didn't mention that it would be torched. The cucumber salad was fresh and tasty though.
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Vika O.,"If i could give it 0 stars, i would! Absolutely awful place. We waited over an hour before our first 2 rolls came out...and they were awful!! Rice was hard and cold. It tastes like leftovers from yesterday. We didn't get the kitchen appetizer we ordered at all. After waiting an hour we ended up canceling the sushi rolls we ordered and left. We went to butterfly sushi a few blocks down."
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Bilguun G.,EJ Sushi is awesome! The sushi is delicious and their fish is fresh. The service is very good and located perfectly in the residential neighborhood. We definitely come back to EJ Sushi for more amazing dishes.
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Sam B.,"Hi, there. It is my 2nd time here. Everything I ordered was VERY FRESH and relatively CHEAP!!! I started with my favorites Dragon Rolls and Salmon Avocado Rolls. Then I decided to go spicy and ordered Spicy Shrimp and Spider Rolls. All the rolls were fresh and well-balanced. My wife had Sushi Maki. She loved it. Very Friendly Staff!!! THANK YOU!

I WILL RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!!!!"
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Nate F.,"This is such a great local
Sushi restaurant in the West Loop and Noble Square area. Such friendly service and they just added liquor to their menu. I would highly recommend EJ Sushi, liquor & new chief makes it a weekly or bi-weekly must if you live in the area."
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Julia L.,"Horrible delivery service. It took almost two hours from time of ordering. Once the food got to me it didn't taste great, although delivery, looked very different from the photos. They did give me a bit of a discount for the length of time for delivery, about 20% of my total. Overall, very disappointed."
ej-sushi-chicago-2,L√©o L.,"I went to this location three times after they changed ownership in 2014. The first couple times we had a good meal with efficient service. We chatted with the pleasant wait staff, who hail from Mongolia, and enjoyed the BYOB. EJ Sushi relies on mailers and coupon sites to draw people in, so we always enjoyed some kind of discount on the check. My third dinner unraveled when my dining partner pulled a Groupon. The waitress must have remembered that I myself used a Groupon a few weeks earlier and loudly announced that we could not use the offer because one of us redeemed a Groupon in the past. 
Now think about this for a moment. You finish a good sushi dinner and are enjoying your mochi alongside some chilled sake and you have to enter into a discussion about Groupon terms and conditions, while all the tables in the small space turn and listen in. We had to insist that there was no such rule and that we had happily patronized the restaurant several times prior. But that night, the waitress seemed to be on some kind of personal mission to ruin our meal. 
We eventually prevailed and redeemed our Groupon but the experience was embarrassing and completely unprofessional.  
We have since been enjoying the sushi and BYOB at nearby Tsukiji Fish Market, where you don't yelled at after your meal, even if you produce one of their frequent mailers."
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Haman G.,"I was make a delivery for the restaurant. When I got there the food wasn't ready. The gentlemen that's was on duty told me I, couldn't wait in his restaurant go outside & wait. Make it so bad nobody was in his business. JUST Prejudice. I wouldn't never patronize his business."
ej-sushi-chicago-2,Hope Y.,"Seriously one of the best sushi spots in the city. Cute inside, never busy (don't let that fool you) and little grocery store next store to grab drinks for byob. There always a groupon which I hope doesn't mean it's going out of business. Seriously, give it a try"
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Maneet D.,"Had a monte cristo sandwich and chorizo omelet. Food was great. Medium potion sizes a

Parking: easy on the street

Service: the staff was very accommodating and courteous. 

It was a clean restaurant with fresh food."
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Athena A.,I'm from Houston and they brought us here for brunch. Very clean and yummy food! One of the best French Toast I've tried!
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Maricela A.,"CASH ONLY restaurant. They have an ATM next to the cashier. I don't understand this concept. I think that most people as myself would love to eat more or try more things here if they accepted credit cards. I try to avoid ATMs greatly so I limit myself with my cash. Anyhow, the service was a 5 stars. They are very friendly, attentive and prompt. The coffee was amazing and I loved that my cup was being refilled often. I order Swedish pancakes with that special berry sauce. Pancakes were very good except that I think they could have loooked a bit more appetizing. My son ordered the pigs in the blanket and they were so good. His hot chocolate was very good too he claimed.
The pace is very small, but for a Saturday in the morning, it was not that busy. It seems that when it's nice outside, they have tables out. I'll definitely come back again and maybe try their alcoholic beverages."
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Marc A.,This place is my go to breakfast place. The Cruz omelette is my favorite. Fresh strawberry preserves given. Bellini also awesome.
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Darian J.,Great for what it is but nothing too crazy to merit a five star review. Service was decent. Portion sizes were decent. Price point is decent. Good specials. Tasty food. Just nothing extraordinary
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Cinthya Q.,"Great breakfast/ brunch place.  We walked right in on a Saturday morning (approx 11:30 a.m.)

The brunch was good- we tried three skillets and omelettes and they were tasty.

The one complaint I have is that our server was not attentive and we needed to ask for coffee a couple of times before he returned.  However, the support staff (bus boys?) were great and quick.  It seemed to me they were more invested in our experience than our waiter. 

Also, worth mentioning to get a side of meat (bacon, sausage) costs the same as a side of their in house salsa.  

Cash only."
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Jennifer S.,"This place is such a cozy little breakfast (and dinner) space! Breakfast includes burritos, huevos rancheros, omelettes, pancakes. They offer many sides. The two unique ones are potato pancakes (stuffed with cheese and bacon) and black beans. I am the biggest fan of the beans! Soooo tasty and delicious! This place offers delivery via Grubhub too! They also have happy hour and Wine down Wednesday (2 for $7!). I wish I lived closer!"
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Victoria K.,"Standard breakfast and brunch options served here. Cute interior, friendly service, but was very slow when I was there. Our server took over 20 min to take our order, even though there were only like 3 other tables here who all had their food. 

The Gold Coast Omelette was flavorful with plenty of andouille sausage and shrimp chunks. The omelette itself was not overly runny or dry. The home fries on the side were just potatoes, there was not much flavor and some drizzle of ketchup helped greatly.

The Chicken and Waffles here were only okay. The waffle was fluffy, but the chicken was just two strips of chicken tenders. I could have made this at home with some frozen prepackaged chicken tenders. 

Overall, decent place for some good but nothing spectacular."
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Chela H.,"I love their potatoes. Staff is always coming to check if you're low on coffee, I'm a coffee drinker so that was a plus. Also, mimosas and available parking.. what more could you ask for."
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Loretta P.,"The Breakfast Club gets more of a 3.5 stars in my book. I've enjoyed myself every time I've dined here, although that could partly be attributed to the company. Either way, the pleasant service is worth mentioning, since establishments aren't always warm and inviting.

I've enjoyed the omelettes, waffles, Kentucky Bourbon Bread Pudding, and the homemade strawberry preserves, My niece and nephew were quite fond of the 
chocolate chip pancakes and bacon. Although it is a bit off the beaten path, and parking can be a challenge, the food is fresh and tasty and it is a charming space. Check it out!"
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Christine K.,The skirt steak burrito was inedible- no flavor; all gristle. We complained to waiter and  check out guy- they didn't seem to care.  Will not return and do not recommend.
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,hanna y.,"Meh. Nothing too memorable. It's a step up from an IHOP or other restaurants in that general category. When we walked in you're hit with an explosion of pink. Think 80's John Hughes.  When we entered there didn't seem to be a hostess there but I heard a voice from the seats saying we could sit anywhere we liked. Odd but ok. I ordered the pancakes because that's what I was craving and a side of sausage. Pancakes were ok but the I did not enjoy the sausage. Tasted a bit undercooked and had an odd flavor to it. 
Another gripe. Cash only. This must be recent because I have been to the breakfast club in the past and we paid with our credit cards. However there ""conveniently"" placed was an ATM machine so patrons can pull out cash."
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Brittany S.,"The only way I'd come back & eat here is of a zombie apocalypse took over & this place was offering the only food in the state. I got a Bloody Mary & it tasted so bad that I had to ask for a different drink. I've reviewed many establishment's bloody Mary's & this was by far the worst I've had. I paid $15 for a burrito that had giant side of ice berg lettuce & potatoes. The burrito mainly contained tortilla & was covered in a thick cheese. The inside was some cheap eggs with very cheap steak. The atmosphere lighting was neat, but everything else was tacky. Not sure why people come here...."
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Barbie D.,"Never had the opportunity to taste the food. Service here is highly questionable. My party of 2 was seated right away, but never acknowledged by our waiter. Had to flag down someone to get their attention for some service. All the while a flock of employees are interacting with each other laughing and joking near the station where the food is prepared. A teenager with really bad teeth approaches our table and the first words out of her mouth is ""I'm not your waiter, but I can bring you drinks"". My response to her uncaring comment and demeanor was at least some form of acknowledgement would be nice for customers willing to spend money at an establishment. She responded with, 'well what do you want?' I don't know if this is a family owned business, but owners should know how unprofessional their employees interact with the customers. Unprofessional behavior will just jeopardize your business. 
Also cleanliness is an issue. I was brought a cup of  coffee and inspecting the cup it was clear that the mug was never washed! Old coffee stain residue was still present inside of the mug."
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,July H.,"The breakfast food itself was great, and well priced. But they are CASH ONLY. I did not know that until it was time to pay. The cashier told me that the ATM inside doesn't charge a transaction fee. But that turned out to be a lie. When I checked my bank account online, it clearly states that there was a $2.50 fee for using this ATM. So be forewarned. Based on this sketchiness, I'll never return to patronize this establishment."
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Mary K.,"Quaint little restaurant with some down-to-earth food. Had a very pleasant breakfast, ordered the skillet and it was delightful.  We also had ordered the pancakes which were very light and fluffy and delicious. I would recommend coming here for an enjoyable breakfast. The service was very pleasant and efficient and it had a nice atmosphere it is small but they were accommodating."
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Monica Q.,"A wonderful diner/breakfast place. We came here for brunch and I got the Breakfast Club skillet. The savory dishes were great, but not necessarily out of this world. The pancakes were absolutely delicious and wonderful. Another great surprise were the special drinks. We came after New Years and they had some wonderful New Years-y champagne cocktails. 

Definitely recommend this place for a delicious and hearty brunch!"
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Dezarey P.,"Very cute spot! Friendly staff, my friend ordered the French toast foster and that was sooo damn good we should have all ordered it! Hah I got the chicken and waffles which was aighhhhtt. Another friend ordered an omelet which we doused in hot sauce to give it more flavaa."
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,Dan R.,"Had a business lunch here, and although the food was good they do not accept credit cards. I was Extremely embarrassed because I couldn't use my corporate card and had to pay cash.  It's extremely inconvenient.  
It appears that food isn't the only thing they're cooking here."
the-breakfast-club-and-grill-chicago,John B.,"The wifey and I have been dining here for years. We first discovered it around five years ago. My wife swears that this place has the best french toast she has ever had. And as her husband I can attest that if we eat out for breakfast, she is ordering the french toast to chase the high she gets from the Breakfast Club's version. 

We now have two daughters under the age of two, so do not go out to eat as often as we used to when we were DINKS. So she was so happy when we awoke yesterday and I said we are going to Breakfast Club. Now that we have young daughters, we do not sleep in, which is great for the Breakfast Club as it can be hard to get a seat.

I generally order the corned beef hash and a biscuit on the side. The service is always good. The place is clean. And the owner is extremely friendly. 

Hands down best breakfast place in Chicago."
pot-pan-chicago-3,Tammy B.,"I love their basil rice.  This is a awesome, quaint little place me and my husband found before going to the Arcade Bar next door, we were hungry and needed to eat.  I looked at reviews and decided to try it.  You won't be disappointed reasonably priced."
pot-pan-chicago-3,Eric S.,"Nearly perfect Thai-ming.

As often as I spend weeknights at Emporium Wicker Park (literally right next door), I'm surprised that I hadn't been here until just the other night.  Well shame on me for taking so long!  This place is quite a treasure.

Seeking sustenance, Anna T and I walked in on a Thursday at 7pm and I was impressed right away by the cute Asian decor in the entryway.  Inside the dining area, they had some seriously groovy music playing--it was Oriental, but with a clubby vibe, and made me want to take a nice warm steam bath.  Aside from that, the bathroom was virtually spotless and the rest of the interior was awesomely tasteful.

I always make a point to order hot tea when I'm eating Thai/Chinese/sushi, and in this situation what I got was quite possibly the BEST cup of tea I've ever drank.  It was jasmine tea, and once it had cooled down a bit I found myself head over heels in love with the sensual aroma and soothing flavor of it.  Not sure exactly what, or why, but that damn cup of tea hit home in the best way possible.

Our appetizer was chicken satay, which came with a tasty peanut sauce and cucumber salad (amazing, by the way).  A good value for like $6, too.  Anna T got some chicken thing, and I chose the pad thai made extra spicy.

While mine was flavorful and indeed spicy, it seemed to be lacking in the chicken department, and also didn't come with the lovely floral garnish of carrot that adorned her entre√©.  I couldn't help but feel a tad jipped by comparison, especially considering that her white rice came in a delightful heart shape (cue the 'awwwwww's') and my pad thai was very unceremoniously slapped down onto a plate.

Bread = 4.5
Circuses = 5

It was very quiet while we dined, but that's just as well, since the atmo in here is more suited towards a dinner date anyways.  Pot Pan will definitely be on my radar whenever I visit Emporium next (which, let's be honest, will probably be tomorrow).

Highly recommend!"
pot-pan-chicago-3,Kerri P.,"Ordered from Grubhub, thankfully GH refunded all of my money. Took almost 2 hours, ice cold, everything had the after taste of poison. The meat was so tough it was almost like jerky. After tasting a few items I called Grubhub to have the restaurant pick it all up...I guess they weren't answering their phone or something so I just threw it all out. Only took a few bites and I already feel sick to my stomach."
pot-pan-chicago-3,Jenn T.,"Honestly just not very good. 

Service is off. Food is off as well. There are better options for Thai in the area, don't waste your time."
pot-pan-chicago-3,Karisa M.,"This place is awesome and byob! There food is so good and super cheap. If you're in the mood for Thai, this place will now disappoint."
pot-pan-chicago-3,john z.,I had the unfortunate experience of ordering Lar Nar and asked to have the noodles crispy. The waiter seemed to acknowledge the request but what I got back was soggy noodles. The waiter said that the gravy made the noodles soft but I've had Lar Nar with the noodles crispy before and never had them this soggy.  When trying to get the waiter's attention to pay for a meal that I couldn't eat he was taking a nap at a table next to me. Not the best dining experience.
pot-pan-chicago-3,Simone R.,"I love this Thai place! It's so bomb. Pad See Eiw, Curry friend rice, and Panang curry are my favorite dishes here. Super great selection of vegetarian food, great drinks also. Love the Thai iced tea. I've always had great experiences here. The man who owns this place is always so warm & friendly also! 
It is also decorated very beautiful inside :) you can always count on a great Thai dining experience here. Good music too!"
pot-pan-chicago-3,Celia G.,"This place is a solid Thai place.  The price is reasonable and food is tasty and not too greasy. The service is always pretty friendly and quick. My dine-in experience has been much more pleasant than delivery.  I tried to order delivery using the yelp delivery app and it was always very slow and the food didn't taste as good.  The many times I went to the restaurant, the  food there tasted pretty fresh and it was never overpowering or too salty. My favorites are the spring rolls, beef noodle in a bowl, tum Kai soup, and pad see you.  It's very affordable and the place is comfortable and never too crowded. I would definitely go back!"
pot-pan-chicago-3,Gil B.,"Always great. Been going here since the old location on North Ave. In my opinion, Rama Broccoli with Chicken is the dish to order. Fast service. Reasonable prices."
pot-pan-chicago-3,Marco T.,"Not the best Thai food I've had. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. For the amount of good Thai food in the area, this place is just mediocre. 

My chicken pad Thai didn't smell that great when it arrived. The dish just didn't have much flavor to it. The chicken was dry and again, had no seasoning. 

Service was good and food was no where near good."
pot-pan-chicago-3,Leslie E.,The food was delish and fast. Better than expected .Will definitely came back to try more
pot-pan-chicago-3,Jenna S.,"This place is open on Christmas, which gives it an extra star in my book.  No one needs to be open on Christmas, Christian or not, but they were the only open restaurant in a sea of closures on Milwaukee, so they were our beacon of hope on a holiday.  

The food here is pretty good.  Big menu, classic dishes, good tastes, nice spices... definitely a Thai place a cut above the rest.  Definitely not mediocre delivery food.  We were all happy with our entrees.  Service on Christmas Day was a bit slow, but there were only cooks and one server, so that explains the delay.  

Plenty of room to sit and I could see this place getting a bit loud if every table were full, but that'd still not be that bad.  Service was friendly, parking was ample outside, and we enjoyed our food choices.  Prices seem standard for Thai food and the inside of the restaurant was comfortable enough.  They deliver, have carry-out, and tables for dine-in."
pot-pan-chicago-3,Nereida h.,"I really like Thai. My niece and I were checking out the young, hip and historic Milwaukee/North/Damen Avenues area, thankfully, found myself in front of Pot/ Pan. Yum.  Don't let the restaurant's facade fool you. It is what makes the neighborhood special. The place is very spacious and inviting with the typical Thai decor. BONUS: it's BYOB!! I had the Spicy Noodle and my niece, the Panang curry. Both were as expected and well presented. I love when establishments take pride in their fair and service and they did not disappoint."
pot-pan-chicago-3,Ryan S.,"Ordered Sweet & Sour Tofu to go. Took twice as long as the gentleman stated it would, and then when I got home to eat it, I find not tofu, but chicken. It is a waste of money for me to get food I can't eat and I made the mistake of not getting a printed receipt. I was very excited to try this place and now I'm not certain I'll return. The extra star is because the white rice was good, I was able to use it for a replacement meal I made."
pot-pan-chicago-3,Glam C.,Ummm food very mediocre would not revisit. It wasn't busy and being a BYOB was a plus.  The Curry was good but the Pad Thai was not.  We did have hair in our food but didn't take it back to avoid another dissatisfied meal.
pot-pan-chicago-3,Amy V.,The first time I ever stepped in to this place was during a snow storm when they were still on north Ave. And hooked. It's never crowded. I don't get it. People are upset because Penny's closed. People! It's a even better. I have tried many different menu items. Authentic and tasty. BYOB. The decor is not hip but the normal kitschy Chinese or Thai place.
pot-pan-chicago-3,Elizabeth C.,"Delicious food with great prices. My friends and I were looking for a short, inexpensive stop with high food quality. It is great for what it is, I ordered Spicy Noodle and my friends ordered Pad Thai and Bamee Barbeque Soup. 

Everyone was well-pleased. I typically eat out once per week, and I wouldn't go out of my way to come back. But I enjoyed my experience here was good without anything super exceptional like I was hoping I would get in Wicker Park."
pot-pan-chicago-3,Anonymous F.,"Despite swearing off this place after our last visit, we were desperate for some delivery. I had Bamee Pork noodles. Just a pile of unsauced vermicelli noodles with some pork slices on it. Bleh. No flavor, no spice. Hubby got pad thai, worse than average. The egg rolls were undercooked and pale. Pot stickers were decent though. The oil that they use to cook this food was just nasty.

I mean it this time. IWe will not be back."
pot-pan-chicago-3,Ben A.,"I ordered the pad woonsen with chicken. The dish comes with thin noodles, variety of crunchy veggies in a flavorful sauce. It was pretty good, nothing spectacular. Good service and affordable.

Small space with booths lining the walls and a few tables and chairs to fill in. Pretty casual and laid-back."
pot-pan-chicago-3,Anthony C.,"This is my favorite local restaurant and it's somehow never busy! The food is really consistently good and SO CHEAP for the neighborhood. The service is unobtrusive and most importantly, some of the best crab 'goons I've had, and I've had a lot. 

The music is nice and the atmosphere is awesome - really pretty interior! They open the windows when the weather is nice which makes it really nice. I can't explain all the reasons why I like it - it's just laid back."
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Robyn T.,"Went here recently for a friend's birthday celebration. We pregammed before we got there, so of course by the time we arrived, we were hungry. It was late so the menu was very selective. We ended up getting an order of jerk wings. They were amazing! I'm usually told that I don't eat chicken correctly (leaving too much meat on the bone), but these bones were dry when I was done with them. The meat was juicy, and fall off the bone tender. The flavor was deliciously sweet yet pretty spicy and smokey. I can't wait to come back earlier to get a whole meal. I'm excited to try their red beans and rice, mac and cheese, and cabbage. 

The reason I gave them a 4 is because at night, it turns into a club atmosphere. It is waaaaaaaay to small to do this. Good music, good food, decent drinks, but they just need more room. Maybe an expansion?

Anywho, I look forward to coming back."
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Katy S.,"Mr. Brown's has the best.....bottled Jamaican beer...that's really all I can say it has the best of. The jerk chicken was too dry for my liking; however, I enjoyed having this Island option close to home. The mac 'n cheese needed to have more cheesy goodness added to it because I don't think it tasted like chedda' to me. It was too plain. Though the servings are bigger, it does not mean better. 

The service was adequate- not overly friendly but not dry either. Chill vibe. 

I'd go back to kick it with some friends while drinking beer, but I'd probably get a jerk chicken sandwich instead to put some sort of sauce on it rather than ""enjoy it"" plain."
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Adenike A.,"I was looking for oxtail during the week and figured iI would find it here. I was disappointed to find that they only serve it on the weekends. So I ordered a jerk chicken meal. It came with rice and peas, plantain, and cabbage. 

The meal portion was very generous. But the chicken was dry and the rice was hard. I was not happy with my meal. I don't remember much about the cabbage. Based on the reviews, I was expecting greatness. I charged it to the fact that it was almost closing time on a Wednesday. 

The service was good though. We were the only ones in the house, the server was very attentive and we even had a good conversation. They played good music and you can tell this is a spot where people gather on a regular basis. If I am ever in Chicago on that side of town again, I'll be sure to stop by on a Saturday for the oxtail."
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Maronda H.,"This is like my second time @ Mr. Brown's. The ambience is very chill and laid back. A nice and enjoyable place to come hang out on a date or with a few of your friends. Nice Music and seating area.

I came out today for a good friend's Birthday  Day Party. The atmosphere was relaxing. It gets kind of busy. The food is not all that good. I had the jerk wings and it wasn't worth the money. The drinks are water down with a bunch of ice and barely any liquor.
The 3 Star Rating is giving because of the nice music, it's very laid back and relaxing."
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Carita B.,"I was there on Sunday. I usually go there once a month. I was not so happy. The service was bad. We had to ask our waitress about drinks for 10-15 minutes. They didn't have any mac & cheese. I guess they changed owners/staff. I like this place a lot but between the wait and running out wings, mac & cheese, long wait for drinks. Not sure when I'll be back. I wonder if it's like this @ the downtown location?"
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Jessie Elizabeth J.,"This lounge walks the line between dance club and restaurant. We came here in the afternoon so seating was still available. The service is akin to what you'll get most places outside the US, no one is treating you like royalty but they will take your order.

 I ordered the Jamaican jerk ""BBQ"" wings which were succulent but the sauce was very light. I had some of the classic Jamaican jerk wings too and these are crisply browned with more flavor. The plantains are sweet and caramelized and the coco bread is like a small loaf of Hawaiian sweet bread-good for sopping up sauce. 

We also ordered the goat platter which was tasty but the meat was a bit lacking. The mac and cheese was nothing special imho. The cocktails are inventive and priced around what you'd expect for the area. I wish the dishes had more spice! 

They have good lunch specials if you're in the area and i'd come here again to try something different."
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Ronnie N.,"This was my first time trying Mr. Browns. I've heard people talk about this place for years, but I've never graced this place. After having two terrible jerk dinners on Sunday, I felt it was time for Mr.Browns to stop this abuse of jerk chicken I had encountered over the past few days and I must say Mr. B's came through. The chicken dinner is juicy and plentiful. Jerk sauce is added on the chicken already, although I wish they would have put an cup of the sauce in my to-go bag. The cabbage is delicious as well. The rice & peas were bland and I didn't care too much for, I've had much better. 

The establishment is clean and the service is OK. There was only one person working the bar and the seating area. The dinners are pretty expensive. With a $2 tip I shelled out $20 bucks. Fine dining at its best. I would like to see them do a ""lunch special"" that includes their signature dish somehow, as it wasn't included in their daily lunch special."
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Remy M.,"The vibe was great as usual, the music was at a nice volume loud enough to be heard throughout the establishment but not so loud as to disrupt the conversation at the table. 
Lisa was the server & although she was definitely animated slightly rambunctious her attention to detail was undeniable & much appreciated. 
Our table ordered the jerk veggie burger, the island chicken stew & the island rum punch. The food came quickly & was cooked to perfection. My food gripe was there was literally a spot of jerk sauce on my burger & the chicken stew didn't have that real jerk taste to it. The additional sauce was a charge of course. Nothing to fuss at just be aware.

Make the trip people you won't be disappointed!"
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Clarissa D.,"Aight, so boom, i walked in and no one greeted me a lady literally walked past me didn't say  anything , i sat myself at a table a lady comes and says i haven't cleaned the table , i said "" you want me to stand up?"" She said it has bleach on it , she finished i sat back down she walked away didn't say anything else to me. Sooo are you not serving food anymore what's going on? Like the energy is terrible if you know them then you get treated right if you don't you get shitty service i came here to dance but dang can a sista get talked to or something? Won't be back !"
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Sarah M.,"Stopped by with a group for a Bachelorette party on a Saturday night. We ordered a lot of food and drinks and it all came out super quick and piping hot. Music was bumping. The bartender was on point with service and friendliness, will definitely come back."
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Darrell B.,"Everything here was good, food took little to no time to come out. Great authentic Jamaican food!"
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Yesenia I.,"I don't eat spicy so my review is about the music. Great place for reggae, and letting loose.  Fyi:pricing for drinks vary by bartender!"
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Gwendolyn W.,"Worst wings, drinks, and service I've received in quite a long time. Wings were extremely dry and tasty liked salty A1 sauce. The alcohol beverages were watered down and expensive. The bartender ignored my companion and I as long as she could before she begrudgingly took our order. If I hadn't heard numerous wonderful words of praise about the wings I would've left based on the crappy service. Wish I would've left."
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Sabrina C.,"A yearning for jerk chicken brought me here. I've known Mr. Browns to have very good Jamaican food, so I knew that I wouldn't be disappointed. Fortunately, the night I ended up going, a Tuesday if I'm not mistaken, the jerk chicken meal which was normally almost 20 bucks, was about half that. 

However due to them being so busy because of that special, the service was horrible. I don't mind waiting for a table when I know it's busy and I even don't mind waiting on service a little, but it was extreme. Then when we finally ordered, one person's food came out 20 mins before anyone elses. The guy who was working as a server had a huge attitude. You would've thought he would've given me the food first seeing that I'm knocked up and all, but nah, he dumped it (literally) in front of the male at the table. He even had an attitude when I asked for silverware that none of us had. Kind of threw that on the table too. It was hard getting service during the meal as far as asking for refills on water or napkins. Absolute headache.

Had it not been for the bad service, I would've easily given this place 4 stars. The food is good, the drinks are normally potent, and the nights they have love music or DJs are normally pretty awesome. Just fell short this time!"
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Asia M.,"Where do I start  ----- 
When we came to the restaurant there were only 4 people there ,,,we ordered   a jerk dinner & stewed chicken dinner and macaroni and cheese 45 minute wait ,,remember only 4 people in the restaurant....
Jerk chicken was fair BUT LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE REST 
My stew chicken dinner was cold not lukewarm but cold
The macaroni and cheese was dry and burnt  our waitress told us that it was the last of the pan so they scraped out the pan of macaroni and cheese and served it to us :(

The cabbage had NO seasoning 

The rum punch taste old ,,,and they need to put a water filter on the faucet if they're going to serve tap water the water  tastes like  chlorine / plumbing pipes ,,,,, 
Sorry STAY far far  AWAY ! 
ALSO our waitress gave us our bill when she delivered our FOOD.   UMMM OK ;  
I will still with The jerk cafe  on 79 and Indiana 
this was a waste of my time and my precious gas

BTW. Our waitress told us that the food steamers were not working properly. So who in the heck is checking to make sure the food is at a safe temperature??? Can you say Ecoli !

Had to go across the street to #Fatsos for  Burgers and Fries after wasting a $58 at Mr. Brown's Lounge

mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Michael M.,"eating my pick up order currently. And have dined in a few times too. Man, jerk chicken is ridiculously good. real slight heat,  great flavor, and the saut√©ed veggies are bomb. 

Now, the real wtf moment: My gf has been a veggie pretty much her entire life. I almost exclusively only eat meat. I tried her jerk veggie sandwich. wtf. I would 100% order that. so spicy and amazing. i hate veggie sandwiches, and this was amazing. ya'll are playing with my emotions!"
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,DeWayne B.,I finally spoke to the manager About a situation is she corrected Best way that she could I have to give 05 stars because she was all standing Thank you for understanding and taking care of your customer
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Chuck Y.,"Not a huge fan of fried wings w/ jerk sauce...Mr.Browns got it right. My take...Jerk restaurants dobt need to offer french fries with their lunch menu. Forced to cop a side of rice and peas for an additional $5, but it was plenty. Definitely a recommendation!"
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Justin B.,"Came by for the jerk chicken special this past Tuesday; that chicken was some tasty s***!

$9 for this much food is a great deal; while the chicken was amazing, I thought the plantains were good but not as good as the ones at Wild Hare, and the rice/peas bowl was only as good as the sauce that was on top (good to start, but by mid-bowl, that sauce was suddenly all gone).  The shredded cabbage was a standout, though...I know that because I ate more than two bites of it, much more in fact.

Service is fast on Tuesdays since I think everyone there was getting the chicken, and there's even a small patio on the Oakley side of the bar.  Come here on a Tuesday to get full fast!"
mr-browns-lounge-chicago,Gisha J.,Love the Jamaican patties but the service here is a different story. I've ordered take out from here multiple times and never was the food ready on time nor was my order ever correct.
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,- Chez -.,"This place was so damn delicious and super authentic. Truly a hidden gem in the city. 
I got invited by a friend to try out a pizza kitchen that he saw online. Of course I agreed because it was food related.. but I was totally blown away with everything.

Decor is cute and the place is perfect size for a few friends or family to get a nice meal and converse. 

We had the two different style pizza's and lasagna (we were hungry--don't judge). Stellar on all counts including the service. 

I will be visiting again very soon. 
Highly recommended."
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Doug B.,"Spoiler Alert:  I am a New York pizza snob.   Having said that, if you check my reviews, I've had a few positive Chicago pizza reviews.  This, sadly, will not be one as the Italian Pizza Kitchen is not the best pizza in town by a large margin.  Though, they could get as many as 2 more stars if they make a few easy changes. 
1.  Don't serve slices from the holding tray without putting them back in the oven. 
2.  Cook the pizza longer. 
3.  Experiment w the crust.  
Why you ask?
1.  My slice was barely warm.  Cheese had set, was thick as it had cooled. 
2.  Looking at the side of the slice you could see uncooked dough
3.  The outside edge crust had nothing going for it.  Just a chunk of dry dough circling a pie. 

I suggest you try this.  Take some dough you make today and put it in a bowl.  Cover with a moist towel and make a pie with it tomorrow.  See how you like it.  

I'll try this place again in a month or two and I'll specifically ask that my slice be heated if they don't do this on their own.  I'll be happy to raise my star rating if they raise the bar, and the dough."
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Jeff K.,This is a hidden gem! I LOVE their pizza!!! Please try the deep dish pizza.  I also am obsessed with the bruschetta appetizer. It was soooo good! Order food from here and you will not be disappointed!
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Jon O.,Honestly some of the best pizza in town. Every time I visit I get one IPK Special pizza as well as the bruschetta for me and my boyfriend and it never disappoints. Will definitely keep going back.
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Jonathan K.,"I absolutely love their wide variety of Italian favorites! The new owner, Alex, is awesome and really puts a lot of care and time into the dishes. Support a local family owned business while having some of the best Italian around!"
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Brooke L.,From out of town and stopped in here to have lunch. Didn't have to pay for parking and was super impressed by the vast menu selection. Food was fresh and super delicious. Only complaint is the food was a little on the expensive side.
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Meg L.,"This place is a nice, little hidden gem. Pizza by the slice is vey convenient! Slices are big & filling. Isn't the best flat crust pizza I've ever had but my entire family eats it without any complaints. They have a different speciality pizza flavor each day of the week. My favorite item is buffalo chicken sandwich & fries."
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,April W.,Very disappointed. I ordered the pasta carbonara (delivery) and I couldn't finish my 2nd bite because it tasted so unappetizing.  When I opened the container it did not look very appetizing. The noodles were complete mush and it had a brown tint to it. I will not be ordering food from this place again.
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Conner R.,"I had some of the best bruschetta on garlic bread I have ever had in my life here. The deep dish is incredible, and the cheesecake was delicious. It's BYOB, pretty decent cost and I will definitely be frequenting this neighborhood Italian."
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Maria F.,I have been going to Italian Pizza Kitchen for years and I think it is the best food ever!!  I felt like I was in Italy when I had the Chicken Marsala!!  So amazing!!  The salads are great too!!
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Karen C.,"The food was good. They forgot part of the order but delivered it promptly.  The cheesy garlic bread was really really cheesy, don't think I've ever had that much cheese on garlic bread."
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Darren E.,Worst pizza in Chicago!  Would rather go to Papa Johns or Domino's.  Stiff crust and cheese that might not be real.  Would rather go back to my high school lunch room and get a slice. Service was even worse.   Had to wait 10 minutes to warm up a slice of pizza.  Might of been the crew that was working but still get it together!
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Corrinne T.,"I just received my order I had placed through Delivery.com. My firehouse chicken sandwich was missing half of the toppings and the chicken tasted like and had the texture of rubber. The cheese for my fries and the can of coke I paid for were both missing. When their delivery driver got here he yelled something through my window as opposed to using the doorbell right in front of him. He then was looking at my receipt as I said where is my drink. He just said, I don't know, they didn't give it to me. Part of his job is to make sure he is delivering the complete order. When I called the restaurant, the phone rang about 15 times before a woman answered and all she had to say was ok, I'll tell him. Yeah, I will never order from or go to this restaurant again, as well as be sure to tell all of my friends and clients to avoid it. Bad kitchen, bad customer service, and bad delivery driver, should be 0 stars."
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Kimberly N.,"EXCELLENT cheese stuffed breadsticks. The pizza was super crunchy which I thoroughly enjoyed.  I loved the texture of their food more than the sauce. This is not the traditional deep dish but for a quick,  cheap bite,  it does the trick.  Soda machine was broken so you have to buy canned soda. Service people were apathetic."
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Wesley C.,"The pizza here is satisfactory and unfortunately we have been spoiled by much better pizza in Chicago.

 About $4 a slice. Cheap price for cheap food. The quality of their standard slices (cheese, pepperoni, etc.) is on par with Chuck E Cheese."
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Adam S.,"Fast delivery, deep menu, and a perfect way to Carbo load for any occasion! Really enjoyed the chipotle bacon cheese fries paired with the Hawaiian chicken burger!"
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Jaci Y.,"Italian Pizza Kitchen probably makes a killing being located next to Jump Zone place So they will be just fine whether or not I return to this establishment. First time my husband I walked in I liked the cashier front man. He was really nice.

We ordered our food 2 slices of sausage pizza and the chipotle cheddar bacon spuds ( $1 more for spuds) Understandable it is a bigger potato. While we waited for our food I checked into the place on my Yelp app. The establishment offers 3 free garlic bread sticks but only if you dine in, sad! I figure why not ask anyways but yeah the manager, or owner seem to stick that stipulation. My thinking is a paying customer is a paying customer right? I spent $14.00 there on a lunch to go why not give me the free garlic bread sticks? At first I was going to get it, but when they realize I was taking my order to go they said No. So I redeemed a coupon with a stipulation of dine in only darn. I was disappointed.

The food is two stars the pizza because it was good. I didn't care for the crust I can make pizza bread I know whether or not the crust was to my liking or not. The crust is too hard to eat when it cools down. I do like the sauce, sausage and cheese on the pizza. It reminded me of Buffalo NY style pizza, It's do type of thing. Although in Buffalo NY I don't recall a slice of pizza being $3.75 per slice. However, we do live in Chicago so everything is more expensive here. An additional star for the chipotle cheddar bacon spuds they are delicious but I wouldn't get them again.

I don't think I would return to this pizza place any time soon. I do want to go back if I was craving thin crust pizza and couldn't find it anywhere else in the city."
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Dany G.,"This place is fire!!! Definitely my go to for quick dankness. Quick, fresh Italian food!

The fried mushrooms are the best shrooms I've had since my trip to Amsterdam. The thin crust bbq chicken is yum yum tasty . I once killed a full pie solo. 

Try their desserts. Worth it if you have a sweet tooth that you can't deny. I know I can't. The brownies I'm reigning,  king dankness. 

5/5 The employees are super nice here too!"
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,Max J.,Great food! Chef Juan is very creative with his dishes and soups. Definitely will come back again and again and again!
italian-pizza-kitchen-chicago-chicago-2,David S.,"New ownership is great.  Very nice, hard working, polite and cool.  Great thin crust pizza!"
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Andrew D.,"Mahoney's is an absolute shitshow. And I love it. My new condo is a mere 1.5 blocks away, so this has certainly become an easy, regular option. Solid beer selection, surprisingly good food, and quite affordable. 

This is one of the few bars in Chicago where you can bring a ton of people without it being too crowded AND play a full on Beer Olympics. Shuffleboard, darts, billiards, beer pong, bags outside, and some arcade games. Huge, open space to do all this, as well. Much larger capacity than most other bars in the area or surrounding neighborhoods. 

Great Reuben sandwich, as well. Highly recommend trying. Accommodating bar staff makes it quick and easy to get drinks. The space is pretty dated, but that actually makes it more welcoming. Looking forward to more drunken good times at this lovely establishment."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Julie S.,"This place is a pretty average sports bar. 

It's large, with lots of seating, including a substantial outdoor area. It's loud. Sometimes, that's live music, sometimes it's just sports bros yelling at the tv (and each other.) For convenience sake, I've stopped in for a drink or a late night meal a few times. The service, food, and prices were all pretty average too. There aren't a ton of other options in the immediate area, so as long as you have average expectations, Mahoney's will fit your needs."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Nancy S.,"My first visit for the happy hour. Wings are 50 cents on Wednesday. Our waiter was funny and accommodating. The wings were delicious. I love spicy wings so the waiter gave me a side 
Of extra spicy sauce. I loved it! The decor was pretty hip and interesting. I will be back on a busier day. Overall my experience was welcome and fun!"
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Kate H.,"It's your standard pub option, nothing much notable on either end.  Came here for Buffy trivia with some friends, and our server was quite friendly and attentive.  It's a large open space, which is nice because you don't feel so 'closed in' like you do at some bars.  There's also plenty of seating, and lots of TVs to watch sports events at.  They also have patio seating, I've not sat out there but it looks nice.  They've got Jameson bottles everywhere (including the chandelier) so the ambiance is pretty cool

The food is standard bar fare, it's good but nothing outstanding.  They did have a $10 Blue Moon pitcher deal when we were there for trivia, which was nice."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Jason H.,"Came here for Harry Potter trivia. It was a good setting for that and enjoyed on that basis...but this place is unnecessarily expensive. $8.50 glasses of Chardonnay? $5 Corona (and that was the special)? Also had a buffalo chicken flatbread that was just ok.

Would not return on a non-trivia night."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Lauren F.,"This review is solely for the St. Patricks day event I attended here. It was advertised as all you can drink with heavy passed h'ors d'oeuvres. The drink specials were good, however I feel like most of the attention for service was spent on the tables, which I understand they did after all pay more to have them. However from an event that advertised heavy passed h'ors d'oeuvres I would have at least expected them to come out earlier than about 1.5 hours before the end of the event. Half the time when they did come out the servers were not able to get more than 5-10 feet without all of them getting taken."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Jacqueline B.,"Mahoney's is definitely a recipe for fun! Popped in here after brunching all morning with friends so we were for sure ready to play some games.

At about 2:00 pm on a Sunday we basically had the place to ourselves which was awesome. SO MUCH ROOM FOR ACTIVITIES. Some pals posted up at the bar, some sat in the back and played darts, and another handful of us played beer pong up front. They also have giant jenga, bags, and that bowling pin game.

Aside from all the fun activities this bar offers, they have tons of seating. High tops, low tops, couches, two bars and even a patio outside. The bar has plenty of TVs and a large screen which is great for watching games. They also have a stage with some pretty fancy lighting I noticed so who knows what other fun activities they typically have going on here! Our waitresses were super friendly and efficient when taking drink orders so high fives to them.

My friend and I got hungry so we decided to order a snack off their menu. Pretty typical bar food choices, but not complaining. We went with their southwest rolls which hit the spot. Sure, they weren't anything fancy and looked kind of like the frozen egg roll-like things you can buy at the store, but they tasted great to me and the chipotle ranch dipping sauce was a nice touch! Someone else ordered the Mac n cheese which looked really good.

Overall this bar is a lot of fun! I'm sure Mahoney's gets pretty packed on weekend nights."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Kristin M.,"This is my brother's favorite bar so we came here to watch the Cubs play in the World Series.  If I was an early 20- something this might be my favorite bar too.  However, I'm a lame not 20-something so I didn't really fit in with the scene.  They did have a lot of TVs but I think they might have previously blown a speaker because the noise was really crackly.  The food is typical bar fare but I enjoyed it.  My only complaint is that it was super, super dark in there.  Like I almost could not see what I was eating dark.  Maybe it's just my old eyes."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Christopher T.,"Been here a few times. It's your standard sports bars with TVs everywhere. Good vibes and good crowd. 

The reason we decided to come here (in addition to the huge TV/projector in the main room) was to play shuffleboard. But their pucks are horrible. They have edges and 3 of them don't slide at all. Can't play with 5 pucks lol.

Didn't order any food. Some other people in the group did and it was standard bar food - not bad, not good though. Waitress was super slow, but it was busy, so I went to bar. But they were pretty slow too.

4 stars because service was a little slow by both waitress and bar - and I can't get over the shuffleboard pucks."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Julie M.,"Not impressed with this spot. It has so much potential, however it's lacking. The food is very mediocre and the atmosphere is kind of sad! They could really benefit by updating the inside decor and liven the place up!"
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,marc r.,"This place is hilarious because it has the potential, the location, the TVs, almost everything.

It's sticky - I don't think they clean on a daily basis.

It's big - Very comfortable on a non-crazy holiday or sports day. Their TV situation is fantastic - giant screens all over the place.

They rudely told me to 'go away' on a bad-weather day because the staff decided to drink instead of work - not a problem, just don't be rude about it. I get it: low customer #'s, why stay open.

That said, with a few tweaks, such as not just serving Sysco-provided, deep fried food & frozen stuff, this place could take advantage of their location, but I doubt they will.

Instead, just run down the street to Grandview, The Twisted Spoke, or the best: The Silver Palm (which is also called the Matchbox)."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Dan P.,"Bar food is average at best. Lots of TVs, good for a game. Over priced domestic beers. Can get really packed so don't expect to hold a decent conversation. Floors and bar were grimy."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Anthony H.,"Sunday specials during football seasons end at halftime, food was served cut to make sure chicken was done, bad/slow service, big screen projection (for game) shakes, overall we won't be back."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Carol K.,"What the heck has happened to what used to be one of my favorite places to catch a game and grab a bite to eat?

I took a large group with me to watch the Hawks the other night, and I swear they only had 4 people working in the entire place that was packed to the gills.

Our server didn't stand a chance as she had every table in the place.  And when our food finally came up (we ordered at 7pm and the food arrived at 9) the food was cold, there were no salad dressings for the entree salads and the tater tots had clearly been sitting out for awhile.

Trying to help and go to the bar to get a drink ourselves was no better as there were only 2 people behind the bar and they couldn't keep up either.  There seemed to be an abundance of bussers but not wait staff . . . crazy bad!

It wasn't like they didn't know the playoffs were happening and the place was going to be packed.  C'mon Mahoney's!  You can do better than this . . .I've seen it!

Still plenty of free street parking which is always a plus in my book.  But you won't find me here during any of the playoff games . . .plenty of other places that can get it right."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Nick M.,"Absolutely my favorite place to go karaoke on Thursdays and listen to live bands on Saturdays! Also, some of the best service I've had around in this neighborhood!"
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Joe L.,"Just a good bar to drink some beers with friends, listen to some good music, play a little jenga, and just have a good time.  During Hawks and Bulls the place is packed, but not when we were there.  Place was empty and I really enjoyed that.  I am a fan of this place, I hate where there are reviews about an empty bar and it's get a 1 star rating.  Maybe you were just not there on their good night.  

This is your average Chicago Dive bar and I enjoy my random visits here.  If you ever are looking for a specific reason to come here, come when they do the HogFight in the summer. Great time and not very crowded, sense a theme here?"
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Julie O.,"Good service, decent food. Tots are very good.

Sometimes they have worthwhile specials.

Giant Jenga is fun. Lots of tvs."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Lisa M.,Gets better every year. Now that Andrea is our go to bartender it makes it all worth while.
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Trevor S.,"What a bizarro bar. Like, what does it even want to be? There's a REDICK Hawaiian cantina in the back that is just so niggardly placed. The manager is a lousy waffle, the kind that just sorta walks around with his head up high and his eyes on the tits.

They call this an Irish bar? HA! Charles Stewart Parnell would roll in his grave. The orgy of Jameson bottles on the ceiling by the main bar area is A SIN against the state. How dare they even try, just kill yourself Mahoneys. Instantly kill yourself.

I hope a fleet of gremlins riggs this place with explosives and damns it to hell, actually, to the Oort Cloud and back."
mahoneys-pub-and-grille-chicago,Niti B.,"This is definitely not my type of place but I would say if you are looking for a fun place to feel like a kid playing traditional boad games this is the spot.

With the DJ playing oldies but goodies in teh background that you can belt out while playing Jenga it is a lot of fun.

Great for groups but word to the wise don't stay here sober because you will be the only one!  If you can't beat them join them is how your attitude should be when you come here!  And just have a great time!"
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Alison M.,"I ordered the vegan breakfast bowl and a smoothie. They were both fresh and delicious, but pretty small for the price. Appreciative of a delicious vegan breakfast option!"
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Nik D.,"This is such a lovely cafe!!! I went in over the weekend to do some work and had a pleasant, relaxing time. Baristas were all super friendly, which added to the charm of my time spent inside. Keep up the good work guys--- anyone can serve coffee and espresso drinks but it is the kind service and attention to detail that really matters. ;)"
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Sylvia O.,"I don't have a lengthy review for Awake Cafe but I stopped in for a breakfast bagel before I caught the bus to work. They offer turkey sausage (I don't eat pork) so I was pretty excited about that. A bagel with just egg and turkey sausage cost over $5, which was a tad bit steep. They had a wide selection of espresso drinks and other snacks for purchase. Plenty of tables and chairs and a quiet environment for studying or reading."
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Bri A.,"I usually grab a latte or iced coffee from here a few times a week. They have an XXL size iced coffee which I definitely need some mornings! We've been here a few times on the weekend for  breakfast. They have a bunch of tasty sounding sandwiches, however the staff doesn't seem to know anything about them!

Today I ordered one that was listed on the board as: Vegan (med ciabatta)-hummus, cucumbers and roasted red pepper. The barista went ""Huh, what's that??"" And we had to point it out to her. They always seem to have no knowledge of what they serve!

We ordered two sandwiches and two iced coffees. Another couple came in and ordered sandwiches. The barista seemed to know them and their food came out promptly, while we waited almost 15 minutes for ours. What the heck?

Food was good but my sandwich had feta cheese on it. I'm not vegan so I didn't care, but the sandwich shouldn't be called Vegan! Also, it was more of a sauce than actual hummus, but the flavor combo was still good. 

Overall this place has good coffee and pastries, but service is meh. They need to train their baristas on the menu and label things properly."
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Madeleine F.,"I like this cafe a lot. I have very consistent good service, I think the Baristas do a great job and try very hard to be good employees.  The food is actually really good too! I would give it 5 stars if it was slightly less expensive."
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Jessica F.,The sunrise bagel is simple but tasty. Girl behind the counter said she's new but she moves the fastest out of everybody and I've never gotten a latte faster. Everybody is super nice. 5 stars for service.
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Kristofer H.,"Stopped in twice while hanging out at Eckhart Part across the street on a Saturday.  First time to get drinks, a latte that tasted like crap and an iced coffee - and will echo some other reviews and say the girl behind the counter had a crappy attitude and seemed like I was annoying her with my order? 

Came back an hour or so later for food, different girl, same story with the attitude - like its a thing here (I swear I was just ordering normal stuff, no whiny special order requests).   Breakfast burrito was good, PBJ was okay, tuna was sorry.

Sadly, I'm sure I'll be back til something else opens up so convenient to the park - but if you aren't dragging two kids around, I'd spend your money somewhere that sucks much less."
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Dan M.,"When I visited: 8.27.16
What I got: Palomino Latte
Drink Review: The Palomino is easily one of the smoothest,  most balanced lattes I've ever had.  This thing drinks like a well made milkshake.  It seamlessly blends milky cream with a sugary sweetness of white chocolate and a vanilla-cinnamon spice combo for a familiar yet formidable flavor to pair with the underlying Metropolis redline-espresso flavor at the finish of each sip.  I must commend the batista here on the balance put into the drink,  as it could have easily been sugary jet fuel that resembles nothing of coffee.  Instead,  the coffee maintains a solid base that in concert with the other flavors,  never let's you forget you are drinking coffee,  not some sucrose infused cappuccino creation (which full disclosure,  I do enjoy,  but are not in the same class as your coffee /espresso fair). 
Caf√© Review:Awake held up to its name sake on a rainy Saturday lunch hour,  with bright studio lights illuminating books and Instagram staging areas alike, while still having a dimmer corner for those still waking up during their visit. After awaking myself with a lox bagel and latte, I came to an observation: this is a caf√® in transition. The Western half of the shop is new,  modern wood paneling and a mellow blend of blue painted wall patterns.  Yet the floor is old,  hardwood with modern wood tables adjacent to a mostly retro assortment of chairs that  appear to be from  the 70s to 90s. Then along the Eastern wall,  there is your usual assortment of art hung for viewing in front of a white studio wall.  Now I understand the desire to highlight the art,  but in cutting up the design into uncoordinated sections the aesthetic of awake make the feel a bit off.  That said,  the staff was friendly,  skilled and quick to address any patron concerns and make them feel welcome. Overall, if this place is still going through some growth,  then I'm excited for them to really find and take pride in their own stride. I'm not saying that Awake needs a wake up call,  but I'm just hoping they can smell their own coffee, and enjoy it fully. 
Overall Visit Rating: 8.5/10"
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Devon M.,"Simple cafe right on the corner of Chicago and Noble with friendly employees. I got the West Coast wrap which was light, fresh, and delicious. My husband went for the Caprese Pesto sandwich which he loved, he is usually a meat man so I was impressed. Not only was the food good it was ready within 5 minutes!

The best part of all was we got 35% off from a Groupon claim deal. Our whole meal chips and all was around $12. Will definitely be back!!!"
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Yvette M.,"Ordered from grub hub for delivery to our hotel.  We have had the breakfast bowl, it looks small but I assure you it's just perfect, the breakfast burrito is large if you're super hungry, the chicken pesto panini and the Mediterranean ciabatta are OMG yummy! Received our orders in 30 minutes. Hot and fresh. Called to ask for jelly and hot sauce, super sweet people on the phone as well. Everything bagels are amazing with house made chive cream cheese too. Perfect and great prices for a big city."
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Zoe Z.,"I come here at least once a week. It's a great neighborhood spot. I love the healthy start bagel. It's reasonably priced, tastes great and is healthy! The people working are always so kind and welcoming. I would recommend going to Awake if you're in the area."
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Peggy T.,"I was pleasantly surprised with this place when I visited last week! The interior is a little drab with old mismatched furniture, but I'm sure it's the look they're going for. I grabbed a blueberry muffin, while my friend got a croissant and a smoothie. Everything was really good and we each were handed a free cookie (which was awesome too)! They have a small seating area out front which is perfect for a quick morning stop. I'm not a coffee drinker but I'd come back for a muffin. Also I noticed they had an interesting lunch menu that I'll certainly be back to try!"
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Miriam R.,Got it delivered.  Smoothie was not even near full and they didn't bother giving me a straw.  Two things I expect for a $5 smoothie ;-)
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Kristen M.,"Seems like a very nice cozy cafe with an assortment of snacks, sandwiches  and beverages. Great background coffee music to mellow out on and plenty of seating .However, barista/cashier didn't seem well informed about food options at cafe and wasn't helpful. She made no attempt at giving recommendations and stared at me blankly.

I'm sure it was the end of the day and she was probably tired and ready to go home - I'll cut her some slack. I did come in 30mins before closing time. 

I'm sure I'll be back to be productive and get work done."
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Marissa D.,"This place seems to have it together. Convenient and fast! I love the Ugly mug but sometimes there sandwiches can take a while to be ready. My breakfast wrap was fast, warm and ready in less than two minutes. The wrap was light and like that of a rolled up egg, cheese, and bacon mini burrito, which was only $2.99! Glancing at the food menu I also noticed they have great price points on there food. (I hate spending more than $7 on breakfast!)  Not to mention the friendly lady behind the counter had great suggestions. Yay, I'm a fan and will more than likely be back very soon. It's quick and convenient for when you have a few mins on your commute back home or to work."
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Martin S.,Giving one more star. Have a medium size now. Still need to do something with the interior. Too much plastic and cheap wood
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Jillian N.,My family and I love this place!!!! The food is delicious and the employees are super nice.
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Genuinely A.,"Nothing obviously wrong with Awake. Espresso drinks (even for small size) served in big mugs. The breakfast wrap was tasty. Free (no timeout) wifi. I'd revisit.

Note: a weird high-pitched sound can be heard throughout. Maybe it's the fridge, maybe the HVAC, no idea. You may regret not bringing earphones."
awake-cafe-chicago-2,K. R.,"Good food and offers various items for a coffee shop.  However, the middle aged, dark curly haired woman running the front counter needs to improve her attitude. Not very pleasant service."
awake-cafe-chicago-2,Gustavo M.,"OK spot. But what's prompting this review is the three really loud employees discussing everything from who might get fired next, to what's on the menu. They're nice people, but but why are they talking/complaining so loudly?? Super distracting as I'm working."
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Cinthya Q.,"Went in for a breakfast sandwich and it did not disappoint.  The prices are great, and the service is quick.  Plus it seemed like a family owned business and I am down for keeping as many of those around. 

The sandwich was good, and it seems like it would be perfect for breakfast after imbibing too much the night before.  I also had the hash browns, and those were a bit greasy but like I said, the best hair of the dog you can of. 

I have to say that I am very impressed with the packaging of the food.  We ordered to go and everything was individually wrapped.  My OCD heart was very happy."
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Randy C.,"Stopped in by accident to pick up a hotdog (which was excellent) prepared Chicago style with fries and a pop for five dollars. Can't beat it. But lo and behold they also have some interesting looking Korean dishes: teriyaki  chicken etc. and Bi Bim Bop. It is a cute, family owned business.  A hotdog stand/Korean food hybrid;one of the wonderful things about Chicago."
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Justin B.,"Hound Dogs isn't very good, but in the realm of San Francisco throwback restaurants where you can get burgers, chicken teriyaki and a freakin' egg/sausage breakfast sandwich--most of which is under $5--Hound Dogs checks the box.  Located in a desolate stretch of Grand near Oakley in the West Town area, Hound Dogs stands out mainly because it's open and there are people walking around here, because for a good stretch of Grand, there's nothing around.  Service was very friendly and fast and the women working in the kitchen were working up a good sweat yesterday when I dropped by.  Some seating inside and a picnic table out back.

Average, fine, safe, but not worthy of a second visit."
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Dustin H.,"Other reviewers talk about how unique this place is, and seriously... it's unique. It's like a time capsule of a time that never happened. A classic American hotdog / hamburger joint with a surprising addition of items like egg rolls on the shockingly inexpensive menu. 

Everything feels a little old, and dated... from the slightly peeling outdoor signage, to the yellowing backlit menu board, but like I said, it feels like a time capsule. It's a good feeling. Embrace it. The restaurant itself is REALLY clean. You can tell from the freshly mopped floors to the sparkling flat top grill. 

Next up, the Bi Bim Bap. Wait, what? As the sign in the window proclaims, yes they serve Bi Bim Bap, along with breakfast sandwiches ""all day"" (they close at 3pm) to burgers and doggies! And it's not 1/2 bad, considering things are mostly pre-cooked and finished to order. The Bi Bim Bap was pretty darn delicious, topped with a freshly griddled egg and the price tag was absurdly low. The lack of freshness is made up in the price.

The hotdog and fries I picked up for a friend were also super inexpensive and I've been told, were reasonably good. Three stars for crazy quick service, cheap prices and eclectic lunch menu.. 

I've been driving by this place every day for over a year and regret not trying it until today."
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Paul G.,"I literally drove by this place and had to stop in because it looked so absurd. Haha. It has a hotdog on the logo outside and then in the window they advertise for bimbibop! ???? Haha. The inside is like an old run down fried food unhealthy hot dog joint but they serve a bunch of American and Korean food. 

There are like 6 old ass men in here an they seem definitely blue collar. The one guy at the front was literally just leaning over the counter to tell them what to make and I think he was ordering like 12 sandwiches no joke. ""No keep the cheese on that one, whatcha making? Yeah ham and cheese and that one too"". Haha honestly so weird.  It seems like the men in here are familiar with the owner. They seems all very nice.

 It's run by a dad and daughter it seems like. Could this place be a gem? Or a shit hole. Well see. Haha. 

//Bulgoki - 6.80$ - it was pretty average but it does the trick. and for the price, you cant beat it I would definitely go back.

They also have some other strange options. Their coffee is not soo good either. Oh and while I was outside I was approached by a homeless person :-) haha i have him a buck."
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Colleen D.,Live right by this place and have never seen it open - turns out they close every day before 3...today I ran over for lunch...tried chicken teriyaki - TERRIBLE.  It took less then 3 minutes so I sort of figured it was premade - the chicken was very dry and just tasted awful.  I may go back for something I can watch them cook - like a burger but its doubtful.
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Ross A.,"A cheap, fast and friendly fast food joint with an expansive menu that includes some Korean items. 

I'd guess that the bulk of Hound Dog's business has long been local factory workers getting breakfast or lunch, so its got that blue collar authenticity that hipsters crave.

I'd give them one more star if they offered breakfast items all day or stayed open later. Or both, ideally."
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Reuben H.,"Ah...  America!  Land of opportunity...  The opportunity to walk into a hot dog stand located essentially in an industrial corridor and get your choice between what many would label ""American"" fast food, and ""ethnic"" dishes as well.

Which makes you wonder (or at least a nerd like me) what made some of those American fast food dishes ""American"" in the first place?

It all was brought over or created by crafty immigrants, or the sons and daughters of immigrants in order to fulfill a need.  A need for tasty, satisfying eats at a reasonable price that could be served quickly, sometimes on-the-go.  Hamburgers- modified recipe originating in Germany and brought over by German immigrants in the 19th century.  Hot Dogs- basically the same thing.  Italian Beef/Sausage/Combo- pretty much the same thing (though substitute Italian immigrants for German ones).

Hound Dogs fits the American fast-food labeling perfectly.  That description being offering up tasty, satisfying, and cheap food quickly.  There are the items we most associate with American fast food- hot dogs, hamburgers, sausages, and an assortment of breakfast plates on offer.  

What makes Hound Dog unique is their additional items that in my opinion still fit that definition of fast food, but offer up more variety to go along with the low prices.

The owners (of Korean descent) have added things like Teriyaki (duh- it's in the name of the place!), bi bim bap (that they call ""Bee-Bee-Bee"" out to the kitchen when ordered), bulgogi, and a few other things more loosely labeled ""Asian"" (which always cracks me up, considering how massive and diverse Asia is).

When you break these things down though, you have to wonder why we don't see more hot dog stands and fast food burger joints offering up these types of things.  Rice will stay hot and fresh in rice cookers for a long period of time.  Marinated beef and chicken sits in the marinade until it is ready to cook up on the flat top.  Plus, who doesn't love a fried egg and pickled vegetables served over a bowl of hot rice and nicely charred marinated beef?  

The common denominator with what we label ""American"" fast food and that which is now known by the ""Asian"" variety is that it can be made up to order fast, cheap, satisfying and tasty.

Hound Dogs and other places like them will hopefully influence places like Portillo's and maybe even those big Golden Arches guys to have cheap Bee-Bee-Bee on their menus some day.  It is, after all, becoming more and more ""American"" all the time.

If the British can claim curry as their national dish, then why can't we have Bi Bim Bap?  U-S-A!!!  U-S-A!!!"
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Michael L.,"Good inexpensive food.  My friend and I each had the bulgogi, and it was very tasty.  Not the best I've ever had, but good.  For $6 it was actually very good.  The size of the order is perfect too, enough to satisfy, but not enough to make you fall asleep after lunch.

To summarize, we almost went back the next day to have the same meal!"
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Loren P.,This hole in the wall Mom and Pop place has a great selection of greasy spoon fair along with some Asian dishes. I'm a huge fan of their Bi Bim Bap which is better then any other places near by. Plus the prices are reasonable enough to keep me coming here on a weekly basis.
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Bryan B.,"The American food is all good and cheap, but they also serve a few Korean dishes. I tried the Bi Bim Bap and it wasn't the best i'd ever had or anything, but for $6 it was yummy and a nice change from italian subs and fast food.

I think they'd do well to play up the ethnic angle a bit more, the asian items aren't even on the menu board, you have to hunt around on the walls for laser-printed signs.

I've complained in many other reviews that ethnic restaurants outside the traditional neighborhoods (chinatown, devon, etc) are rare and usually expensive, so it's nice to see cheap Korean outside of the typical Korean areas of the city, just wish they offered a few more asian dishes. I bet if more locals knew it was more than a hot-dog stand, they'd do better. They have a few small signs that say ""Teriyaki"" I don't think that really attracts people that may get excited about Korean food. Maybe they don't want to alienate their working-class clientele. (and ""Hound Dog"" is definitely a bad name for a Korean-American restaurant, ha!)"
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Rob B.,"Hound Dogs looks a little whatevs on the outside but after I finally went there I was pleasantly surprised. I had the spicy chicken which is from their Korean menu. It was fresh, affordable and tasty.  My gf had bulgogi  and she enjoyed it as well. We will be back to try the Bi Bim Bop."
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Sarah C.,"extremely affordable and just-right portions. i had the #9 today, which consists of a crispy chicken sandwich, fries and a drink = $5.25 all in. highly recommend."
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Mike O.,"I went to this place based on the recommnedations of other reviewers. I must say it certainly isn't bad. Unusual combination of American fast food and Chinese food, but I can't complain. The menu boards are somewhat old and could use updating. They serve breakfast and lunch and close around 3:30 daily.

I had a cheeseburger. Not bad. Skinny patty but bigger than McD's or White Castle. The onions, lettuce and other toppings made it pretty decent. The fries seemed pale to me but actually tasted very fresh and flavorful. Onion rings were very oniony-tasting but I wish they served more. Definitely not bland either. My son had a plain Vienna Beef hot dog and probably gave them the best compliment for his age when he said ""It was yummy"" as he left the place. The 3 of us ate for less than $8 so it is pretty cheap. Service was quick too. 

Nothing spectacular, but a good spot for a quick lunch at a great price."
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Andrew K.,"I have worked pretty close to HD for a couple years and every time I go by I get a smile on my face...how many other places have signs that say burgers and teriyaki?

Anyway as others pointed out it is owned by Koreans which is why I usually get the bi bim bop or the bulgogi...it is decent, but the meat is not high quality by any means...very stringy...gets points for the name and because the owners are amiable,"
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Neil A.,"I suspect the reason Hound Dog's went into the location it did was to solely serve the employees in the Kinzie Industrial Corridor just south of Chicago's Ukrainian Village. Knowing this, they designed the menu around what your average Joe wants for lunch. The guy who runs the place is Asian and he knows Asian cuisine, so he had to throw that on the menu. 

What you get is an impressive variety of selections to choose from. A whole menu of Asian food and a whole menu of pure American food. Oh yeah, and he offers the food REALLY CHEAP.

The staff is nice and the food is decent and plentiful, especially considering the prices, which I have yet to see matched at any other hot dog or asian cuisine place in Chicago. (Less than $4 for a gyro? Less than $5 for Chicken Teriyaki and white rice??)

I can't really think of anything negative about this place other than the hours are limited (only open until 3:30pm). Check this place OUT!!"
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Dane K.,"I've been trying to review this bizarre Chicago hot dog stand for many months but couldn't figure out what the place was called even... The sign doesn't seem to be on the front.  I only noticed today that the sign in the private lot says Hound Dog (I usually just pull up scootsie in the street).

I've only been for breakfast, not lunch or anything.  It's pretty cheap, which I guess is it's appeal.  I have had the steak sandwich, which while cheap was just kinda ehh. But again, really cheap.

I think the owners are Chinese, so they also have a few Chinese food items thrown into the menu. 

They seem to attract area blue collar worker types.

It's a bit strange, but if you're looking for cheap eats maybe this is the place.  The food alone is probably closer to 2 or 3 stars but the price helps."
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Ingrid G.,"Ingrid says ""You won't be crying all the time if you stop by the Hound Dog Grill on Grand!"" (That's my check please intro--sorry, couldn't resist...) HD's has been at the corner of Grand and Oakley since I was knee high to an urban pioneer taking the shortcut down Oakley to Juvenile court. I had often passed by, but never ventured in. My recent Korean food obsession compelled me to stop here today and try the Bi Bim Bop.  If the litmus test for a good restaurant is being popular with streets and san guys, then we have a winner.  Kind of a no-nonsense place. They turn out the food really quick. Mostly hot dogs and beefs. But then you have the Asian angle which is cool! Also, the place is spotless. Also, cheap cheap breakfast sandwiches!"
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,emily b.,"fast and friendly, this place is just as the other reviewers noted... no-nonsense, cost-effective, and speedy.  

it's not delicious, but if you're looking for convenience, this may just be the spot!"
hound-dogs-burgers-and-teriyaki-chicago-2,Tina P.,"Ok, for all the other reviewers, the owners and food are KOREAN. not Chinese. 

Now, the Korean food is really good and it is authentic.  The prices are really good, considering Korean food is typically pretty pricey.

There are also burgers, hotdogs and other fast food items on the menu. 

Overall, everything on the menu here is really good!  The staff and owners are really nice and friendly and the place is super clean.  If you are ever in the area give it a try!"
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,G R.,"Solid fast food, open till 9:00 p.m too! I think they have one of the best Reuben's around, it's my go to sandwich just about every time. My husband has tried many of the other offerings here with no complaints.

So for me it's the Reuben, soup or a chocolate shake. Yup, stick with those!"
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Anne W.,"Burger baron is one of those greasy spoon joints that people go to because it is fast and quick. There's nothing special about this place but there also isn't anything offensive. I go here because it is across the street from my office. If it were not across the street I would never come here. I've only tried the gyro here and it's your typical fast food gyro. It always satisfies the craving but it doesn't do much more than that. It is incredibly greasy though so it occasionally does give me a stomach ache like any overly greasy food would. So definitely keep this food consumption to a minimum. 

Overall I come here gradually it is fast, easy, and reliable. I wouldn't make a special trip to come out here. I do enjoy the fries here however and they're always very generous with the ketchup packets when you're taking the food to go."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Mojo M.,"Love this old school place: good food fast for not much! Tried the new chorizo wrap this morning--mmm, good. With a small coffee, $6.50 and no need for lunch!"
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,John S.,"So I have been here twice both times about 7:30am on a weekday before going to work. The first time I really wanted a burger for breakfast so I stopped in for a cheeseburger & fries. It's a step up above fast food and thats about it. The burger lacked flavor and was needing salt & pepper to make it ok, fries were fine. Second time I had an omelette. About the same quality as the burger, overcooked eggs with some basic ingredients, potatoes were ok. 

So this place has been around for a long time, like when there was no residential around the area and you fed the working class any shift. Would I come here for the quality of food? No. But I would go back because I can get a burger at 7:30am. I do think the prices are a touch high for what you get."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Eric. P.,"Stopped in for lunch. Ordered a  cream of chicken rice soup & this soup tasted really good.  It was a big portioned  bowl of soup and heck, I could've just had that and would've been satisfied.
But what grabbed my attention was that they have a chicken gyro served up like the regular gyro. Yes i said a chicken gyro. I've not seen this anywhere else. This is a1st and its your regular gyro  but with chicken. It taste lighter obviously  & had all the fixins as the regular gyro which by the way they also have. I found me a new place  for gyros and its been here for a long time. On the corner of Noble and Grand. The fries were a little disappointing because they were a tad bit shy of being burnt. But other than that, there is s large menu, the prices are very good and there is  enough seating in the dining area to comfortably enjoy whatever meal you choose."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Joey A.,"Just left Burger Baron in Chicago.  I'll start at 10 minutes after I ordered a chicken breast on pita, small fries, and mozzarella sticks. I get up from where I was sitting to see how it was coming along.  Because the line is visible, I can see my ""grilled"" chicken breast on the flat-top, along with a pita.  I can also see that there are no fires ready or cooking and no fryers down or filled with mozzarella sticks. I can also see the only line cook paying more attention to his phone than the food.  After roughly 90 seconds(not sure why o decided to count), the cook turns away from his phone to flip the chicken breast, and sure enough he flips it right into the grease drain in the front.  Gross. So he sprays it with what looks like water and then covers it, still on the flat-top.  And goes back to his phone.  After a few swipes and touches of his phone, he takes the pita off the flat-top, puts it on the prep board station and goes back to his phone one more time, and then goes back to put mayo, lettuce, tomato on it, and then leaves it in the basket and goes back to his phone.  About 3 minutes later he flips the chicken breast one more time, and then transfers it to the prep station, slices it, and places it on the pita in the basket, and then goes back to his phone.  After two minutes of watching my sandwich sit there, I say to the cashier that I think my sandwich is done, but his line cook is spending more time on his phone than on my order.  He then looks at the ticket, and proceeds to drop fries and mozzarella sticks.  By the time the sides were finished, my sandwich was cold, the fries burned my mouth because they weren't properly drained, and the line cook on his phone had said a few choice things in Spanish which I wasn't supposed to understand.  Unfortunately, I know what A La Verga means, and it's not the nicest of things to say.  Needless to say I won't be back anytime soon. Down hill big time."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Lord Winston C.,"Solid beef and burger joint.  Nothing special, just good artery-clogging Chicago classics."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Havsh B.,"Place is trash, 10 min waiting in line, I was the only person in line.. 30 min wait for a burger and fries. Don't waste your time here."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Andy S.,For one afternoon me and my coworker decided to stop here and give it a shoot notice how all the workers have beards whit no beard nets so i order a hot dog and surely enough 2 pieces of curly black hair in my hotdog yeaaa that pretty much took my appetite away thanks alot guys for killing my day
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Dennis N.,Great neighborhood spot for some delicious fast food. We haven't been disappointed with anything.  Chicken Gyros is my FAV!
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Zachary H.,"I  usually like this place, the  food is usually good but I'm very disappointed today I felt like a gyro plate, for $12 highly disappointed never again, and as discussed overcooked. Next time Zeus in Greek Town for my gyros only."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Ross H.,"If you have the word ""Burger"" in your restaurant name, you better have good burgers (just ask Bob Belcher). Unfortunately, when I order a Jalapeno and Cheddar burger, ""medium"", what I got was a 1/2 lb. flavorless patty cooked to ""well-done"" with a slice of lukewarm processed mild cheddar and pickled jalapenos that had no flavor or heat. It was edible, but that's about all I can say about it.

The fries were cooked well, but I went to a place called ""Burger Baron"" for the burgers, not the fries. Combined with the ""you're-wasting-my-time"" mentality of the counter staff, I left with a bad taste in my mouth (and I'm not talking about the burger).

Usually, I believe many Yelpers here in the city are overly critical, but in this instance, I feel they are not critical enough. With so many other great options for burgers in Chicago, this place is a hard ""pass""."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Bonecrusher F.,"This place is great. They do it right. Service is fast and food is very tasty. Best thing about them is their consistency.  My favorite sandwich is the chicken on the pita bread. I don't know what they do, but the chicken is never dry. One thing I learned from 30 years of eating fast food ( I'm still alive)- is you can't buy experience.  These guys are experienced and it shows."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Dustin H.,"The burgers are huge, fresh and delicious. They are also kind of expensive, but you're paying for the quality. Not much more to say about this classic joint. Old school atmosphere, and at least on my visits, friendly service. 

The parking lot in bag is a huge bonus for an easy in & out lunch break."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Svitlana S.,"Burger is terrible,meat is dry. Salmon sandwich is very very bad. Inside I think is not salmon,this is another fish. Just french fries is good."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,David M.,"Over priced, long waits, poor value, low quality. Denver omelettes should come with cheese. There are a difference between hash browns and fried potatoes. Potatoes were under cooked. Will not be returning for breakfast."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Smooth D.,"I've never eaten a turd sandwich, but Burger Baron served me the closest thing to it. My wife's cooking is so much better, and she can't cook to save her life. My trash compactor brother even pushed away his greasy, fatty Italian beef and proclaimed their take on food ""egregious"". His wife had a chicken sandwich that was too small for the bun and the price. My wife also had a burger, but unlike my turd, hers was like a hockey puck. Last but not least, the fries. Why do they use Marketday French fries? These sham fries were tiny and unseasoned (is it too much to ask for salt on fries?), it's not 500 B.C., salt is not expensive, I don't see Phoenicians using it as currency. I generally don't complain, but this place is terrible. Best part was, the meal only cost $53.27! Sorry, did I say best part? I meant that for $53.27 we could have gone to Gibson's and got a real burger. 

Please save yourself the gastrointestinal problems and a wad of cash and go somewhere else. Don't patronize this awful place, stay away and hopefully they will go out of business. 

Unfortunately, I live down the street, and my other option when I'm hungover is the Breakfast Club, another feces-hole with awful food and high prices. Both of those travesties need to cease to exist. I'm sad just thinking about living near them."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Rory V.,For when the hangover consumes your soul. For the day after the Cubs win the World Series and you were out way to late spraying champagne in others faces. I ate the whole thing and I gotta say it healed me. This burger was no match for the different combination of alcohols I consumed last night. Burger 6 hangover 0. Plus these guys are grinding hard back there to make you a hand made burger.
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Malachi L.,"In the past I have had a great experience at the burger Baron. Today I ordered the Greek plate with a drink and food it came to $15.00. There was a very small amout of meat which was over cooked , the rice was under cook and a very small proportion. The only highlight was the salad. I don't recommend the greek plate."
burger-baron-restaurant-chicago,Carla J.,"Thank you for telling people you decided to go with a cost effective meat product on your salmon sandwich. I expected a salmon filet, but as the owner informed me at the restaurant, instead of when I placed my order, they switched to a cheaper salmon burger. THEN MOVE IT TO THE BURGER MENU SINCE IT IS NO LONGER A SANDWICH!

Trust me I would totally be willing to pay for the higher cost salmon filet because you guys usually make it taste great. Or I would be willing to pay for the lower cost salmon burger, as long as I knew it was a salmon burger patty. I just went there two weeks ago had the filet, man was that delicious. too bad."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Caroline K.,"I'm staying with a friend that lives in the area and needed to get some work done so I headed over to Cafe Blue.

It's attached to Jerk, Jamaican style food, which also looks great, I'll have to try them! 

Back on point, the staff is very friendly and this is the perfect spot to bring your laptop and have an amazing Carmel latte, seriously the best latte I've ever had in Chicago.

I also order a chocolate scone, but it was sugar overkill and I couldn't finish it. But still delicious.

I'll definitely come back and totally recommend if you're in the area."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Nate M.,"I've got a pretty lengthy review for Cafe Blue already, so I'll try to make this one brief. The quality at Cafe Blue is still pretty good. The prices are still a little too high, but ultimately its convenience for me makes it worth the price. Lately though, the service is a little lacking. I often have to stand around for five minutes before anyone shows up to help me. Today they are just randomly closed. Several of us buy muffins and bagels here everyday for breakfast. Several of us are very hungry this morning. 

Cafe Blue... I've given you a lot more money than I feel like I should. Maybe you could just be open when you're supposed to be?"
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Jenny H.,"Last time at Jerk, I'd managed to polish off my entire platter of Jerk meats and sides, plus extras. Instead of the usual feelings of dread, shamefulness or disgust after consuming said large quantities of food, I took my accomplished self down the hall to Cafe Blue. Gotta rest and jumpstart the digest[ion]!

It's a small, cozy alcove framed with distressed blue shutters featuring Halfwit coffees and an assortment of pastries. My cappuccino was smooth, well-made and STRONG. Just what I desperately needed. I only wish this place had longer hours on weekends because I'd totally walk over for some caffeination and some light work."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Danny W.,"It's finally open!!! 

This cafe inside of Jerk's brand new storefront has been a long time coming. The sign has been on the front of the building for literally almost 9 months, and although I was a little underwhelmed at it's offerings, the coffee and croissant were very spot on. 

They only have java and a few pastries, but it's a nice little add on after a plate of Caribbean food for lunch. If you work in the building you're gonna be stoked at a new option at your doorstep."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Nari H.,"Any cafe that uses half wit beans is a win. Tried a cup of drip coffee, an Ethiopian blend, and it was pretty great. I prefer coffee with more complexity, so I enjoyed this spot. Friendly people. I'll have to come back to try the restaurant."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,M. J. W.,"The cafe is consistently quality stuff. I'm more of a fan of the hot bevarages over the iced - the iced ones seem to lose the impact of the bean even with their filtron coffee press. It's filmy and leaves an odd aftertaste. But their espresso and americanos? Fantastic.
The staff generally is nice, not the fastest but earnest. If I see 2-3 people in line, I tend to skip it in the morning as they never staff more than one person it seems, even for the AM rush. 
My only 2 real critiques - they charge for simple syrup - I don't any other that does that. $.30 of sugar placed in hot water and you have to charge so much for it? Your sugar packets left on the counter cost more than that per serving. And lastly, they've made mistakes with my order, and when told there was a misstep, they like to make sure you messed up the order not them. Again, not bad qualms, just something to keep in mind."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Will M.,"Average coffee in a surprisingly inconvenient location.


Now that Cafe Blue has finally opened after a year long build out, I was excited for a new morning coffee option on the drive to work. The regular coffee comes in one size small/medium for $2.50, and though it is done by local roaster Halfwit it was pretty generic. I guess I had hoped for something more exotic or island-y or... Jamaican? I would expect that any Jamaican Blue Mountain coffee would be tastier and more thematic. 


To round out the order I got an English Breakfast tea and a pastry. For the tea I was given a cup of warm water and a point to the boxes of tea bags on the counter. As for the pastry, when I asked where they were from I was told ""the La Boulange."" I wasn't sure if the fellow meant ""the the bakery,"" ""the the starbucks,"" or if he really meant ""the La Boulangerie,"" but wherever they come from it was a tasty (albeit $4) chocolate croissant. 


Unfortunately as there is no parking on Chicago or Halsted, and no space (or even loading zones) on Green or Superior, I imagine this will end up serving mostly people who already live in the handful of residential buildings at that corner. According to their website there is parking available...somewhere, however as of this morning it wasn't marked nor posted in the store."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Suzanne A.,"Great cafe! Coffee is on point and the staff is super friendly. I'm here almost every day. It's not a place I would really sit and hang out at but it is a place I will grab a good coffee from! 

Cold brew can be purchased in a bottle. Vanilla is made in house. They have an amazing machine that lets you froth almond milk (as I can't have dairy). 

I love this place! It's a hidden GEM on Halsted."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Tom I.,"Good coffee, good internet, friendly staff. Not a bad place to stop in a work for a little bit. Couldn't tell that it was open from the outside so I almost missed it, but I'm glad I stopped in to see what it was like inside."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Jen M.,"Cool little spot that is attached to Jerk restaurant.  The smell of the food coming out of that place was amazing.  The area to sit in on the coffee side is too small and confining so we sat at window seats on the restaurant side.  Coffee was good.  Almond milk...yep, they have that."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Bridget J.,"I work in the building and only go here if I am running late and can't stop somewhere else because it is not the best..... Staff is nice and its a cute shop, but coffee is way too over priced (although I have heard rumors they lowered their prices).

Salted Caramel Mocha is awesome but DO NOT GET THE PSL!! The PSL tastes like old lunch meat and leaves a gross taste in your mouth, if they could change the PSL I would go back."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Becky L.,"2.5-3 stars.

I work in the building that Cafe Blue is in and we were SUPER excited to finally get a coffee place in the building since the nearest coffee is Dunkin Donuts about 10 mins away.. 

Here are the cons:
1. Ridiculous prices- Small Iced Coffee is around $4.15 compared to $2 at Starbucks and $.99 at DD from 3-6PM
2. The coffee is pretty bitter and nothing special for the price. That being said, the coffee has a TON of caffeine that gets us through the 2PM afternoon slump. 
3. They have very few food options: 2 croissants, a cookie, donuts, and muffins. If you ask them to heat up the croissant they can't because none of the food is made there. It's just delivered and put in the case. 

Their pros are the convenience of location for people who work in the area along with the customer service. Everyone that works there is very friendly. 

Cafe Blue has some great potential but really needs to step up their game on their pricing and menu offerings!"
cafe-blue-chicago-5,J C.,"This coffee shop is my spot!

Do I work in the building? Yes.

Have I come here on my day off? Yes.

Do you need at least two dollars and some change for a cup of coffee? Yes....welcome to the world of quality beverages. 


Since they have opened I feel a personal connection with every member of the staff here.

They ask me about my day and I ask them about theirs.


Their espresso is on point and the iced coffee is great.


The pastry selection is small, but the items are always quality.
I recently tried the new guava butter on toast and have already gone back twice for it."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Katya G.,"I love this tiny little coffee shop. Kind of hard to find the entrance from the street, but the espresso drinks are really well prepared and the staff is incredibly friendly. I'd give it five stars if they had other flavored syrups besides vanilla!"
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Courtney N.,"Being a huge fan of Jerk's food, I tried out their cafe next door. Their coffee is amazing, the staff is really friendly, and the pastries are to die for! The island vibes are also an awesome perk, the esthetics are on point. There's an area to work right by the cafe as well that's sectioned off from the Jerk restaurant, they have free wi-fi so it's a great spot to work from. There's plenty of space and it's right by huge windows so lots of natural sunlight. It's now one of my go-to spots to eat and/or work - awesome lunch at Jerk followed by a perfect cup of coffee."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Daniel R.,"I work in right next door to Cafe Blue. It is a great place for an afternoon pick-me-up. Their coffee selection is pretty limited, but good overall (a bit bitter, but not bad at all). I usually go in the afternoons, so there really is no wait. I haven't tried their iced beverages, but it is on my to-do list."
cafe-blue-chicago-5,Katherine H.,"I work in the building, and usually bring my own coffee or stop in route to Starbucks because the prices and size of the coffee is beyond a RIP OFF! They only offer 1 size coffee.... a tiny coffee cup. 

I decided to give them a second chance after the owner made an effort to reach out to individuals in the building saying he reviewed complaints and made adjustments to the price. The small (only size cup) coffee is still more expensive than a Starbucks venti coffee AND the kicker, I brought my own tervis cup, not creating more trash for the planet and saving them the cost of using a cup. At Starbucks, if you bring your own cup it is cheaper- promoting reducing our carbon footprint. However, at Cafe Blue they will charge you the exact same amount AND refuse to fill your coffee higher than what their cups fill, despite not wasting or using the cost of a cup they wouldn't give a little more coffee or comp the price for bringing my own cup. In asking about this, the woman at the register told me their coffee beans are much more expensive than Starbucks and the cups are basically of no cost. These magic beans do not taste too magical. I still prefer Starbucks any day of the week! 

Nice to see that Cafe Blue is not environmentally conscious and do not value their neighbors in the  building.... When Love's cafe was here, everyone in the building ate breakfast, got their coffee, and had lunch there. Value your customers, don't rip them off. 

PS- Today is National Coffee day too, you think you could be generous to fill up my Tervis cup a bit more for a paying customer!!!"
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Kathleen S.,"$6.50 for a huge slice of pepperoni pizza that could probably feed two people. I went here for lunch and the restaurant is clean. The pizza was okay. It's not something that ""wowed"" me but it was decent. Personally, I like my pizzas a little bit saucier but it fixed my pizza craving. The pizza just tastes like tomato sauce, cheese, and pepperoni. I added the chili pepper and herbs, so the taste was a little better. The service is good and quick. Not bad for a lunch away from the office. I'd probably go again to try their stuffed pizza."
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Maronda H.,"This is the worst Pizza Place that I ever eaten. The lady at the front cashier was rude and not polite. I waited half of my lunch waiting on an order of fries. My pizza was cold and disgusting. 

The only good thing about the pizza is that the slices are huge. But, what's a huge slice of pizza when it's nasty. It was just a bunch of thick nasty cheese stuck on some dry dough pizza crust.

I won't be coming back spending my hard earn dollars at this place. 
Both Stars are giving to Marcelino and Charles for their amazing smiles and making the customers laugh."
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Stephanie H.,"Good pizza if you're desperate or in a pinch. I had always heard of this place being good when you're drunk, and I'd have to agree. Unfortunately, I was on my lunch break at work."
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Christina S.,"Huge slices of pizza that are New York Style...excellent and soft crust, generous toppings, and cheese-a bit skimpy on the sauce but good!

I also like that they make Russian Dressing ""from scratch"" and their salads are generously portioned, colorful, and creative and includes a half a baguette (with entree salad).

One of my favorite things is the fact that you can take home a mason jar packed with meat marinara, regular marinara, or pizza sauce that is house-made!

The guy who packed my pizza sauce jar and made my salad was very kind, polite and professional considering this location closes at 3pm and I was there at 2:30.  Thank you!

Family run and operated restaurant and it is obvious that they care about the quality of the food."
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Emily Y.,"Called at 10 am for order pick up at 12:00. Arrived at noon and was told we have to wait for 20 minuets!!! Plus, order was placed wrong. Horrible store management! Be aware if you want to place order ahead of time. You will not get it on time!"
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Eddie F.,"Had a slice of sausage around 1 15 on 1/9/18

Needless to say was sick 5 hours later puking it up 9 hours later with it still not digested.  May not want to have the pizza with meat sitting so long. 


Sadly cant recommend no matter what the value"
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Phil P.,I consider myself to be a pizza expert as many. this albeit on the greasy side. I know it said jumbo but I wasn't even able to finish this slice...wow
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Adam B.,"Usually I come in here because it's the new home of Perry's deli, well at least this new scaled back version of Perry's. But in the mood for a slice, I decided to try one of their jumbo slices to find out if bigger is always better. 

I got a stuffed slice of old world pizza and a small fountain drink. The total came to ten bucks, which seemed really high. But the slice is so large that it's basically the equivalent of two typical slices. The crust was crispy on the outside, as it should be. But it had a very plain flavor to it, like a Giordano's. Sauce is a big deal to me and this was loaded with sauce that just tasted like straight tomatoes. I had to add a good deal of Parmesan and oregano to give it the flavor I like. I ate half, and when I have the other half, I'm adding some sauteed spinach on to balance the flavor out.

It was an ok experience, but I can't say that I'll be returning."
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Sara T.,"The service was good but unfortunately I feel like my mouth was assaulted with bad food. Everything was over-salted and too heavily flavored. I ordered the tomato soup and the cheese fries. I ended up throwing out some of the fries which is a first for me. The tomato soup tasted like a salty tomato sauce, and a bad one at that. Did not know it was possible to mess up tomato soup. The prices are steep too although portions are big."
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Ben A.,"Co-workers and I ordered the jumbo pizza (Tuesday special for $24.99), which is advertised as 30 inches and tipping the scales at 10lbs. We ordered with sausage and pepperoni and it took about 30 minutes from placing order to walking out with giant pizza box. The pizza is comically big!! I have to admit I was skeptical whether or not the pizza would be edible - rest assured the pizza was pretty damn good!! Decent crust, stringy cheese, just enough sauce, and flavorful toppings. We all enjoyed our #giantasspizza"
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Gabriela B.,"How do you mess up pizza and pasta? 

If you change your dough this could be half way edible."
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Shareef Y.,"They desecrated the Perry's name. His legacy is forever tarnished. Please for the love of meat, remove any mention of Perry's as you do not know how to make a sandwich. I've never walked out of Perry's as hungry as I am now. What's worse then the lack of quantity is the lack of quality. They went from in-house prepared meat to store bought, frozen, processed, ""stuff"". Allegedly they think its meat.

I'm gonna have to take the rest of the day off from work to grieve for Perry's."
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Charles M.,"There is something very novel about eating a piece of pizza way bigger than your face - and Bacci does just that. However as far as flavor and everything else I look for in a good slice of pizza, Bacci doesn't really have much else going on.

It's a fun place to stop into once, but I think for me once was enough. Nothing bad really just a bit bland on the flavor side.

Worth checking out though!"
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Jack W.,"Okay, the pizza slices are REALLY big! More than the average sized person can probably eat at one sitting. So, if you like leftover pizza, this place is for you. However, if you are like me and expect a slice to have flavor, you may be a bit disappointed. It wasn't bad... but it wasn't anything I would go out of my way to eat again (and work across the street from this place). The sauce was like something you would buy in a jar at the supermarket. Void of any seasoning. The cheese did not appear or taste to be of good quality. It was just tasteless white stuff. Favor-wise, I would prefer a frozen Tombstone over this place. 

To be fair, they also serve sandwiches. Maybe next time a co-worker wants to go there, I'll try a sandwich instead..."
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Jaime K.,"If you're really drunk, this is a good choice. If you're sober and it's before 10pm, there's more out there for you, keep swimming. Now, if you have been drinking and happen to be like a minutes walk from this place, give it a shot. They have big slices of pizza that will satisfy your munchies. Sober people, you have been warned. Drunk people, you deserve pizza."
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Daniel K.,"Love this Pizza!  The slice is so large, you need nothing else for the rest of the day!  It is a must.  Right amount of cheese and perfect amount of sauce.  Love Chicago Pizza"
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Linda N.,"Passed  few times with placard outside but not open.  Now open!!

I picked up a jumbo slice.  I asked for sausage, but apparently sausage big slices include pepperoni so I had to pull all that off. 

Slice was decent, good chewy crust.

As I am approaching cashier (where u also place ur order),young man prepping orders(who looks like a younger Dave Chappelle (damn I miss him, I digress) asks me if I'm getting a slice, ahead of the cashier asking me.  I see why, they have pizza prepared and will put ur slice in the oven for a minute.  Mine could've  used more time as it was warm not hot.
Obviously you can custom.order your pizza but I don't have that kinda time for lunch.
 

I'll stop back to try sandwiches but likely  not another slice. They have wings, pasta, salads, Italian sandwiches, panzerotti, pan thin and stuffed pizza.

My one visit summation is ...good, but I wouldn't  wait in a long line for it"
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Rachel R.,"Stopped by on a Friday around 2:00 PM with my co-worker to check out their pizza slices and the service was awesome they were very friendly even when they are about to close for the week. Pizza was good too for the price, we tried Sausage and Pepperoni the slice was huge it can feed for 3 people."
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Maomi O.,I was downtown for a business meeting and was starving when i came across a Bacci's i was so exited!!! Let me start off by congratulating whoever had the idea of having Perry's deli inside of here is pure genius!!!! I've had them in the past and i was so exited to see them combined!!! I had to have both so i had a roast beef on rye and a tomato soup. 1 its like Perry's never left and 2 Bacci's soup is so delicious!!! i could not leave without buying a massive slice to go and this will be my dinner tonight and I'm not sharing!!!!!! staff was very friendly and the manager even takes time to stop by and ask how everything was!!!
bacci-pizzeria-chicago-15,Jordan L.,"This is an absolutely huge slice of pizza.  From a quality perspective, it's average to below-average.  But you get your money's worth. 

I would probably give it three stars, but last time I was here there was a cockroach crawling on the napkin holder.  Obviously, if there is one out in the open there are probably a bunch more back where they make the food.  I won't be going back."
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Deepak H.,Dropping by this sandwich shop on our way back from six flags. Loved the idea of fresh ready to order subs and sandwiches. As a tourist it was our first time eating at this chain. Came around 7pm and it wasn't busy at all. Parking was small but we found a spot easily. Service was great and efficient. I ordered the Vito sub (had to give some love to the original Italian sub) with bbq flavoured chips. For a chain I was pleasantly surprised with the freshness of the ingredients. Didn't have any issues thankfully. I personally loved the sign of do's and don'ts while eating there. It's the little things after all that make a place great. Haven't ever tried the delivery service so I can't comment on that. But maybe next time when I'm visiting we'll try that service.
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Mel G.,"I wasn't going to say anything the first time. But this situation has happened a second time. Both times I ordered online and asked for EZ avocado. Both times I've been charged for extra avocado, only this time, there's no avocado on the sandwich! The first time, they offered a % off my next order. So I called in and ordered and let them know that I had a discount from the avocado mess up. The delivery guy gets to my door, and they STILL charged me full price. Again, I'll have some sort of discount for my next order, but I 100% anticipate another mistake."
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Jon R.,More like freaky slow. I only live a few blocks away and delivery can take an hour. They refuse to deliver drinks that are not cans but still charge you for fountains. My order is constantly messed up and they don't even bother to credit or redeliver what was missing. Go to Bari up the street and avoid this place.
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Jessica S.,I waited almost an hour for my order. Missed my lunch and went to work without eating. The store is a 4 minute drive away from my work. That is ridiculous.
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Cory E.,"The worst, slowest JJ of all time. Been a loyal customer for 3 years and easily been waiting on avg 35-40 mins. Freaky fast, try slow as shit."
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,max f.,"Food ok, can't mess up a sandwich but the service sucks. The parking sucks . Can't blame them for lack of space. But service sucks"
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,M. J. W.,"Come on guys, do you think you can try a little harder? I was a part of a group order today - as we tend to go with Jimmy John's 1-2x a month. And, they tend to be on point. Things do go wrong, some people are missing a cookie here or there or sides. It happens. But calling this place - or even using the corporate site to provide feedback is for naught. I guess I'm just done with this location. My order was missing two things, no big deal. I just wanted to let them know I didn't get the pickle or mustard packets. I seriously was not going to ask for a re-delivery. I called - all I got was serious, serious attitude that I was wrong. Woa buddy, calm down and brush that hipster biker beard of yours. 
So, when I order, I'm going to skip this Jimmy John's. I don't have time to attitude even if you're  one of the better sandwiches around."
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Sean H.,"So I don't really need to review Jimmy John's from a food perspective, so consider this for the employees/delivery/parking lot.

So the crew that works here is awesome, I've been in to order personally probably 4-5 times, and they are extremely friendly, attentive and fast with the order. I know that is to be expected, but they seem to really try to make sure you have the best experience possible. Smiling counts! :)

I've also ordered delivery, and just like their commercials, its been freaky fast, so kudos there too.

The one gripe is the Parking lot. It is a very small lot, and being connected to a starbucks brings a lot of traffic, and a lot of cars that don't move for hours since people chill out in there. I've gotten lucky with spots, but could see that being a major pain, if driving there, you may want to take any spot you see on the way there. This would usually be something to bring a review down from a 5, but I don't think there is really anything they can do, so they can keep the star.

Overall, great Jimmy Johns to order in store or get delivered, you get exactly what you expect!"
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Craig D.,"It's Jimmy John's. You've never been here before?

Well as to this location, all in all, it's good.

HOWEVER, for eating in, the music is always way too loud and 95% complete crap.

It was so bad today I was inspired to come write this review!

Update: well at least the music is a notch quieter (still too loud tho) and it was a slight improvement in selection.

Anyhow though the girl working there now, big white girl, wow, worst employee ever at this location.

I want more funny votes so here ya go:

""A farmer in the field with his cows counted 196 of them, but when he rounded them up he had 200."""
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Len W.,Done with this chain for good. Turn down the fucking music. This ain't a nightclub. And no need to keep the air conditioning at 50 degrees. Enough is enough.
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Anne H.,"So 1st they forget the bacon on the Club Lu Lu. Then when the guy shows up with
the right sandwich, he inspects the one I'm giving back - I guess I get that. But seriously? You think I am lying about bacon? Then the replacement sandwich is on the wrong bread & has none of the extras I ordered. 2 sandwiches & they get both wrong. Will never order from this location again. Bad a sandwich place cannot get their sandwich right TWICE! ..........."
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Patti L.,"Dinky parking lot, hard to get out once you are in. It's just a sandwich!"
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Heather D.,"This location has parking making a convenient stop. I personally enjoy the quick delivery. They always get the order right, yay!! The delivery guy even smiles after an 8 flight walk up and a jumping dog!"
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,G R.,"I come here sometimes because it's the only quick option. The other reason is my mom likes JJ's, because the bread is softer than a traditional sub. She also loves salty foods, all you need to do is look up the sodium counts on these sandwiches and you'll see that they're up there. Some of them have more than a Big Mac.

The atmosphere puts me on edge and makes me angry, I finally realized why the other day. For the rare times people choose to eat in you'll notice they're shouting at each other because the music is to damn loud. Now I know why the place is largely empty the music drives people out like those ultrasonic bug killers do, perhaps it's also driving out any bugs too. 

I need to plan better, I need to get my order into Bari first, pick it up then go and get my mom's. Life is too short, calories are too high, if you're going consume a large amount of calories and salt for that matter, it should at least taste good."
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Samantha A.,"For a brief moment in time, my office was one block outside of the delivery zone for this location. It was a bummer. Every now and then, they'd let us slip through the cracks and allow delivery, with us tipping handsomely for the trouble. Now it appears we're back in the zone, and we still tip handsomely.

Everyone who works here is really awesome. We've never had any trouble with incorrect orders, and our sandwiches arrive lightning fast, even when its rainy or temps are in the negative. We totally appreciate it, dudes. You're the best!"
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Mark A.,"The crew that works here...awesome.  Way cooler...and friendlier than the normal Jimmy J's ""Hey-Hiii-Whats-UUUUpp"" standard friendliness that we're all used to when we walk in a Jimmy Jay's.  There's just something about the way I'M greeted by this multicultural haven of sandwichdom every time I walk in.  Yeah, it's a sandwich you say.  I say, Good for you Steve Urkel, way to be smart...but YOU walked in here in the first place. Whether Bari's open or not, you stepped in here.  Embrace the love, the ""unwich"" and $1 day olds that they happily throw a poor man's way.  

If you DO walk in here, be HERE not ""I wanna be over there,"" and passive aggressively pout.  Don't be mad because you didn't get what you wanted first, you spoiled, eating out already idiot.

The guys and mean-muggin' gals running the store, the sammich counter and to-go orders, they do work and they have fun doing it.  They have fun doing it for YOU.  Just ask 'em.

So yeah, I like this place.  They like me and I did NOT receive any day olds in exchange for this review.  Or a pickle.  But I got a smile."
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Mayra M.,"This Jimmy John's is the best! GREAT SERVICE... VERY  polite ... And DELICIOUS! SHOUT OUT to Nate , he makes the best sandwiches, is very generous and makes you want to come back  Nayeli"
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Bre C.,the whole point of ordering jimmy johns is to get a decent sandwich super fast.  this is the the second time where i have waited 45 minutes for delivery from this location. absolutely will not be ordering from this place again.
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Kevin W.,Why the hate? This place is great. I like it more than Bari deli a block down that everyone raves about. (bread here is softer).  Way better than subways. Just as good but different from potbellys so not comparable (potbellys is more toasted bread). Thoroughly enjoyed the Italian w hot peppers. Thoroughly enjoyed writing this review as well.
jimmy-johns-chicago-41,Julie A.,"Ok, weird to be reviewing Jimmy John's, but it has a huge perk - open until 10:00 p.m.  
Bari closes early, and I would never eat Jimmy John's during Bari hours, but its good to have close by for last minute eats."
taco-boy-chicago,Dana H.,"Great spot go grab delicious Mexican food. Shrimp tacos are perfect and , the quesadilla was a perfect amount of everything. They include this creamy green sauce, which was unique and tasted great. Staff and owner were very welcoming and truly cared about Their customers. Will definitely be back!"
taco-boy-chicago,Paul Z.,Good authentic mexican food in an area that  needs some good authentic mexican food. Located in the little plaza with the Mobil  station makes it easy to get in and out quickly without any parking hassles. I think they have been open a week and I've been there twice already.
jimmy-johns-chicago-66,Richard A.,"Great service ,  staff freindly, love the fact they reamber me every time a come it could be a month since my last visit or two weeks. For me that outanding customer service.   5 star plus, it's good to see people that enjoy what they do and see its customers as  there neighbors, friends.  Upper manament make sure you regonize good people that work hard.

To all at this JJ. Great work keep up the good work."
jimmy-johns-chicago-66,Kai E.,"The women working here (shoutout to do you Demetria!!) were very sweet and nice! Other than that, it was pretty much just like eating at any other jimmy johns. Oh! The bathrooms here were very clean and had facts about Uranus on the ground by the toilet which was a nice addition I'd say."
jimmy-johns-chicago-66,Kate C.,"Worst Jimmy Johns experience and I have been to many! I ordered a sandwich and the sandwich maker immediately started on it while I was still asking a question, I asked for a pickle to be cut up and put on it and the sandwich maker said no that can't be done (odd it is done elsewhere and why don't they have pickle slices in the first place?!). So because I couldn't have pickles on it I didn't want the tuna sandwich I would rather have a turkey so the sandwich maker huffs and is obviously pissed she has to start over and even commented to the 2nd sandwich maker but she should have waited for me to confirm my decision since I was asking a question about it before starting there was no one else in the store even! Well I got my sandwich to go and take it home to eat it, it's a sloppy mess and I found not just 1 but 2 types of hair on my sandwich when I was rearranging the mess. Blond hairs and black hair neither matching mine... So disgusting and immature that they put hair on my sandwich because I changed my mind after my question was answered! So will never eat at this Jimmy John's again and it's too bad because I just moved to the neighborhood and it's the closest to me but obviously poorly run and not worth giving my business to if they don't care about customers."
jimmy-johns-chicago-66,Louie N.,"I work nearby & wanted something light & simple.  JJ fit the bill.  Appearance coming in seemed fine.   There were 2 female sandwich makers, female on cash register, 1 male mgr(??), & a male delivery guy.  No one was waiting so I was next.  Female cashier was talking to delivery guy about receipts.  I selected my chips of choice, jalape√±o, and just needed to place order for sub & drink & to pay of course.  I waited almost a minute before being greeted but I wasn't properly greeted.  The cashier rung up the chips & asked if this was it.  Hmmm I came to JJ in the cold for chips???  And there's a Mariano's nearby.  Hmmmm.  I gave her sandwich order.  Gave me change then said thank u.  No hello, no thank u for waiting.  The staff was too busy discussing birthday plans for sandwich maker and fooling around.  Sandwich was sub par.  Next time I want a sandwich, I'll take $11 and buy the groceries at Mariano's.   So not worth it, well at least here."
jimmy-johns-chicago-66,Erin S.,I've never been in a dirtier Jimmy Johns. There were no customers in the store other than us and all of the tables were disgusting. How hard is it to clean off a table? I would never come back here.
jimmy-johns-chicago-66,Lauren B.,"Super courteous guys, fast and efficient... But, very patient and make great suggestions! Love this location."
jimmy-johns-chicago-66,Leah B.,"Bad policy. Normally I get delivery to my office which is just about 5 minutes away from this JJ's. Today I was passing by, so I thought I would just pick it up on the way. I ordered my sandwich along with a CAN of diet coke. Gentleman at the register told me that cans were only for delivery. I asked does that mean I have to go back to my office and place an order for delivery to get a can of diet coke? He said I would get a can if it was delivery and it would be an extra 50 cents. Dude! Charge me an extra two bucks, I don't care. But I don't want fountain, I want a can. Anyone who is a diet coke drinker knows there's a big different in taste. I hope it was worth it for this JJ's to lose my business (which is usually 4-5 times per week for my office) over refusing to give me a can rather than fountain. Bad bad business."
jimmy-johns-chicago-66,Kevin T.,"Love jimmy johns.... That sweet mayo, avocado spread, and soft bread, turkey toms...  Friendly staff.  Remember you can have your sub any way you want it... Though no more sprouts.  I couldnt be happier this one opened up near me."
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Dinah R.,"My taste buds are extremely picky. I was a bit apprehensive about eating food served out of a truck. So I decided to be adventurous and give it a try. I ordered the beef tacos and a side of their colorful slaw.

The tacos were an explosion of Latin flavors. The meat was perfectly seasoned and it had small chunks of sweet plantains  that help balance all the bold flavors . The colorful slaw added nice touch.  Sweet young lady on the truck gave me a complimentary order of guacamole, have to say it was fresh and tasty.

Not many people can recognize and appreciate latin flavors. This truck delivered, my taste buds were happy!"
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Cely R.,"Well
Y try the combo 2 tacos mini side rice and 2 salsas
Tacos was ok salsas no flavor at all. The rice so sm side i find one gandul  only"
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Nicole H.,"Just tried chicken tacos and guacamole and chips at the Daley Plaza - To say I was very disappointed is an understatement. The taco and rice combo includes 2 bland tacos, a spoonful of sour slaw, a small container of salsa and a 1/4 cup of dry rice and it costs $9 - way over priced. There are not even any toppings in the taco - just chicken and a flour tortilla - not even cilantro. The guacamole and chips were awful. The chips were stale - so there was nothing to even eat the guacamole with and the guacamole tasted like it was not fresh but rather pre-made by a chain grocery store. My friend had the bbq pork tacos and was equally disappointed. The meat was dry and grizzly - blah. 

With so many food truck options, we will not give this another shot."
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Alejandro G.,Love the tacos. Food was awesome. Taco truck great idea. Would recommend to all. The chicken was my favorite. Salsa was awesome too.
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Linda N.,"as much as I love the carne Molido, I disliked the chicken.  I wish I got both beef.  Molido is soooo good.  moist and flavorful.  I will be back for this."
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Kathleen M.,"Kismet - we found another food truck we had been wanting to try.  The gods must have been smiling upon us as the weather was perfect, we were in the beautiful bubble that is Hyde Park and we got to try the mini tacos.

We each had a chicken taco with mild salsa and fusion slaw.  Absolutely amazing with soft melt in your mouth tortillas wrapped around tender chicken.  Spice it up with the salsa and slaw and your mouth is saying, Fiesta Fusion!

Yes, we were snacking our way around Hyde Park and smiling about it!"
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Michelle M.,"Hello! Taco's from a bus? Brilliant! I had the chance to order from Taquero Fusion while I was at Taste of Chicago 2013. I ordered one of each veggie and chicken taco.

Both tacos were good. Staff was friendly. Price of tacos was a bit much but I'll still order from Taquero Fusion."
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Evelyn P.,"I heard this was coming to my place of work and was so excited! Especially since they carry Arroz con Gandules!! I never get a chance to have this for lunch unless I make it myself! 

I have to say the tacos were not great but decent. However, the the Arroz con Gandules was SO NOT Puerto Rican. Puerto Rican inspired maybe, but not Puerto Rican. NEVER EVER use parboiled rice for Puerto Rican rice! It's dry and not authentic. It was a miss for me. Nice try though."
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Lauren H.,"This was a food truck at my corner that I hadn't seen before, so I decided to give them a shot. I had the taco box ($8) with two no carne tacos, mango salsa, and a side of jalapeno rice. Everything was bland, bland, bland and disappointing.
I love to support entrepreneurs and small businesses in these difficult times, but to compete with the other food trucks out there, even just the ones that come to my corner, you better step up your flavor game."
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Stephanie L.,"So this place was at Ethyl's for the Thursday night food truck-aganza.  

I was a virgin to this experience so I was really excited about trying all of the food trucks.  Not to mention, I decided to try this on the hottest day in September....the only day in September.

This little truck stood out to us because it had a video screen....OOhhhh, Ahhhh.  Haha.  Anyway, it got our attention :)

We asked the ladies what was good and they suggested the steak and tilapia.  We went with the steak and chicken tacos.  They gave us one each of the hot and mild sauce.  

The steak taco was my FAVORITE-O of the night.  So much flavor packed into this little taco.  It was amazing!!!!  The chicken was just ok, but hey the steak made the experience worth it.  At this point, I didnt care that it was 100degrees and sweat was pouring down my legs in September.  It made the experience worth it.

Plus, it was CHEAP!  $3 per taco which was a great deal"
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Dennis L.,"I love Food Trucks!  

Taquero Fusion marks my first food truck visit in Chicago.  I decided to go with the Taco Box which included two tacos, arroz con gradules (rice with pigeon peas) and fusion slaw.  I went with the carne molida taco and fish taco.  Both were delicious.  The rice was also very tasty!.  The fusion slaw was good, but I could have used a little larger serving.  

Overall, a solid experience.  I would visit the truck again."
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Nick T.,"There was literally nothing I liked about this place.

I just had lunch at the Daley Plaza food truck rally and paid $9 for a trio of tacos. In a way, it makes me feel better that I didn't just pay $9 for bad tacos, they were the worst tacos I've ever had. 

Each of the tacos had only two ingredients: meat and tortilla --although since they were probably cooked last night, the ingredients sort of melded into one soggy mess (the truck didn't even appear to be equipped to make anything fresh, they only pulled out tacos from a giant warmer and stuffed them in a bag.). 

The ""slaw"" that it came with was one spoonful of sour, pink cabbage. I didn't even want to finish my spoonful even though I was still quite hungry and dissatisfied after my tacos.

And as if things couldn't get any worse, their slogan is: ""Tacos With a Latin Twist"". Perhaps I've been living under a rock (a rock with decent food) but where I come from tacos are already considered ""Latin"". NOT COOL TAQUERO FUSION!"
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Teresa E.,"I was quite disappointed with the food truck yesterday at the Evanston Food Truck Festival. I believe I was ripped off. When the gal took my order, she charged me $12. I go to pick up my order, they hand me chips and salsa, and was told that salsa was on the ticket, not guac. I said that is not what I wanted. She said I had to pay $3 more. So, I went ahead and paid the $3 and they plopped the guacamole on top of the salsa and chips.

I wasn't thinking straight, as I was tired from standing over a half an hour in line. I should've told the 2nd woman that I had paid for the guacamole: $12 = $7 tacos and $5 guac. Also, I should've protested when they just plopped the guac. on top of the chips and salsa.

Some of the chips were soggy. Also, the sign said we would get a mixture of chips and plantains, but it was only chips. That is false advertisement in my book.

Also, one of my tacos were falling apart and they were both soggy and cold.

Next time, I will go to the tamale truck instead."
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Angie M.,"Food trucks in Chicago have it rough, man.  I don't know what the story is now for cooking on the actual truck, but I have to guess the vast majority, including Taquero Fusion, prep their goods off-site.  You can tell.

I ordered up a beef taco and a chicken taco.  They got it right by serving a heaping helping of meat into two corn tortillas, but that's about it.  No onion.  No cilantro.  No tomato.  They only had the mild salsa, which is LAME.  The lettuce was huge, leafy greens that didn't fit the taco at all.  

Vegetarian rice was boring and sticky.

$8 for 2 tacos and a scoop of rice is criminal."
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Annie N.,"Just finished my lunch from Taquero, honestly I wasn't impressed at all.

The food sounded a lot better than it looked than it tasted. I got a vegetarian taco and chip & guac. The veggie taco was sooo small, definitely not worth almost 3 bucks. Kinda greasy and lack of flavor. The guac & chips were skimpy as well, and for something advertised as ""mix"" (Tortilla Plantain Mix), I found 4 pieces of plantain chips in my box. Not that I cared, because the plantain chips weren't good. The guac tasted decent, and that was perhaps the best part about the lunch. But it was brown by the time I got to eat it (about 10 mins later)

The girl who was working the truck was unfriendly. I wonder why she even bothered putting out the tip jar. Also, the pricing is f-up. A taco is 2.79, and a chip & guacamole is 3.99, total out to be 6.79. Yet the combo of these two things is 6.99 - I'm confused? Isn't it supposed to be cheaper with the combo? Anyway, yelp described it well: meh, I'll spend by 7 bucks for tasty fresh Mexican at Chipotle."
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Shradha A.,"Limited in vegetarian options, I had the mushrooms on soft taco and do want to make a special mention of their salsa/sauce, which was very good. But overall, probably not impressed but I'm sure their meat options are bigger hits."
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Stef M.,"Its good, but not great.  I tried the steak taco and daily special tilapia lemon taco.  The tortilla impressed me the most, it was a fresh flour and kind of spongy.  More topping choices would be welcome, my tacos came with tomatillo salsa and red cabbage.  Onions, pico de gallo, bell pepper, carrot, or really any other topping would welcome.  I wasnt dissatisfied, but I wanted to be more impressed from a Fusion Taco truck."
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Megan M.,"I had the bbq pork and mole chicken tacos from the food truck. I thought they were great, especially with the little sides they provided. The rice was just OK, and the tacos look like they've been in a heater for a while, but that's what you can expect from a food truck. Overall I thought the two tacos I tried from this food truck had a lot of flavor. I will be going back!"
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Kristin S.,"Eating right now.......
Taco Box - $8
2  greasy pre-made steak tacos with nothing but steak wrapped in a soaked tortilla.  No onions, no cilantro, nothing.  The grease is disgusting and dripping.
1 tiny ramekin of ""fusion slaw"" - It is tasty, but need a bit more than a tablespoon
1 ramekin of Hot Salsa - Good Stuff
 1/2 cup soupy pintos with a tiny slice of bacon.  Luke warm and very runny.

Verdict - Terrible  - I want my $8 back."
taquero-fusion-chicago-3,Elise K.,"Had the pleasure of getting to try this food truck a week ago with my colleague in town from Boston.  

The Good:
Truck accepts credit cards and was parked right on Monroe & Dearborn outside my office.  The ""BBQ Carnitas"" tacos were AMAZING... I want more!  They had the perfect mix of pork, seasonings, lime, barbecue sauce, cayenne pepper  and flour/corn tortillas.   The ""Pollo Chon"" tacos were good and meet was juicy, but left something more desired.  They had USDA Choice Chicken, olive oil, spices, garlic, onion, citrus and cilantro.  Tacos are $3 each.

The Bad:
I got the last two ""BBQ Carnitas"" tacos so I had to share one with my colleague in trade for one of his ""Pollo Chon"".  I didn't much care for the ""Fusion Chips"" (Plaintain, corn, salt lime).  There weren't very many for $4 and they were a bit stale.  The Guacamole was good, but not the best I've ever had.

The Ugly:
The portion on the chips and guacamole was skimpy.  Also, they charged $10 to my colleague who had ordered 2 tacos and a chips/guac order.  Instead he got the meal of 2 tacos and rice ($8).... yet he still was charged $10!  It was raining and cold so we didn't bother to go back."
tamale-space-charros-chicago,Andrew S.,"How this place only got three stars is beyond me. I haven't tried their vegetarian only tamales, but their regular ones rock (try the pork ones, delicious). The guacamole is pretty awesome as well.  Plus the guy that runs this is awesome. He's super nice and pretty funny. 

If you see this truck anywhere, definitely check them out. I work off of Michigan Avenue and the food trucks change out nearly everyday, so whenever I see this guy down there I run down and get it. They're only in the area maybe once a week, but definitely worth it."
tamale-space-charros-chicago,jesy b.,"The Thursday truck near my office in the West Loop features tamales from Tamale Space. Given the popularity among my coworkers (self-proclaimed Mexican food experts...) I expected a bit more. The veggie tamale with carrot, potato and mushrooms is good, but definitely left something to be desired. While the serving portion was generous, $7 for two tamales seemed a bit steep, or maybe I've been spoiled by the Tamale Guy. 

On the very positive sign, the service is spectacular and friendly. Plus, the guy behind the truck counter was wearing a Mexican wrestling mask. Can't beat that."
dinner-with-dale-levitski-at-relax-lounge-chicago,Jill B.,"Being Top Chef fans, my husband and I were extremely excited to hear about Dine with Dale.  I immediately checked the calendar to find a date when we could make the 3 hour trek to Chicago for the experience and I emailed the lounge asking to make dinner reservations.  Received a confirmation that we were set for the evening of 4/9.

Honestly, when I checked the menu that morning, I had some real concerns about making the trip (and spending the money on gas & a hotel, etc).  Amuse:  Brie Apple & Pecan Quesadilla.      Entree:  Turkey Pork Meatballs with Spinach Pesto & Garden Veggies.  Dessert:  Milk Chocolate Mango Parfait.  I was worried about the strange combination of ingredients in the Amuse/Dessert, and the Entree seemed a bit plain/boring for such an event.  Luckily my husband was really looking forward to this, so I tried to stay optimistic and we went. 

The Relax Lounge was a nice little bar/restaurant with a pleasant atmosphere.  We arrived a few minutes early and had a seat at the bar for a drink. Once we were seated, the waitress stopped to make sure that we didn't need any additional beverages and answer any questions about the menu.  The waitress/waiters who attended to us get 10 stars.  Our water glasses were never empty.  

A quick disclaimer: I like great food, but my experience with ""gourmet meals"" is limited and I have an uneducated pallet. I tend to pick safe (my husband would say boring) foods when ordering from a menu. That said, here is my take on the evenings meal.

 The Brie Apple Pecan Quesadilla was not really to my liking. It was grilled and had a smokey flavor which I found to be a little overwhelming. I typically am not a fan of anything smoked, but my husband was very pleased with it -- he finished both of our servings.  The turkey pork meatballs with spinach pesto and garden veggies was anything but plain/boring!  The meatballs were seasoned perfectly and the garden veggies with the spinach pesto made the meal.  This is something I would never have ordered off of a menu but I am hoping that Dale will have it on the Town & Country menu because I can't wait to have it again. I'll be looking for a recipe to try at home, too. The dessert, milk chocolate mango parfait, was served a mango soda.  I've never completely understood why this is sometimes done, but I do now.  The sweet parfait followed by the tart mango soda was a perfect combination. This is also something that I would be very happy to order again.

Dale did make a brief appearance at the end of the meal.  He stopped at each table to say hello and even took pictures with a few of the diners (Hubby forgot our camera). When we complimented the terrific flavor of the turkey pork meatballs, he shared that he had reservations about putting it on the menu because it seemed plain/boring (hmm... don't know who would ever think that.) but he knew the taste would win people over.  I wanted to ask for the recipe, but figured that was a big ""no, no"" so I refrained (although, I do plan to do some digging on-line to find something similar).  

The meal was absolutely wonderful!  We are already making plans to return to Chicago in June to enjoy Dale's cooking again."
chicago-philly-stop-chicago,Anuj S.,"This seems like a new place, but they're going to have to step up their game. The delivery was through Postmates and so that went fine. I got the food on time and everything I ordered was there.

The food itself... Not so much. The pizza was completely geeasy, soggy, and sauceless. Actually, these are probably the biggest sins when making a pizza. I've rarely had pizza that I thought was bad.

The French fries in the other hand were fine. I mean, good fries. Fine. No biggie. Oh, they sent me this kinda weird watery ketchup. I used the Heinz I had at home.

I think this place needs to step it up if they wanna play in Chicago. Pizza is sacred here. You can get by with just fries."
chicago-philly-stop-chicago,Laquesha H.,The food was great but service terrible. The delivery driver didn't deliver all of my items I purchased and I had to call and argue that there was something missing. Instead of them being reasonable with me they continued to argue that the driver stated that he did deliver the items in which he did not. I was reimbursed thanks to yelp eat24.
chicago-philly-stop-chicago,Deborah C.,I expected the food to be as good as the multitude of photos they display. I was sadly disappointed. I paid almost $8 for a cheesesteak. They take portion control to another level.  I  unwrapped the sandwich and could only see bread all they way around. I'm usually leery when a restaurant is empty but the photos looked inviting. Don't waste your time or money. I'd tell you how it tasted but there wasn't enough to do a taste test.
burger-king-chicago-67,Augost P.,Staff was friendly. Food wad fast. Tables were a bit dirty. Not bad for a Burger King.
burger-king-chicago-67,William M.,"This place is not doing very good.

One thing I notice that drives me crazy is that they make you wait a minute or two at the register before taking your order.  They do this to make it so that the computer says that you didn't wait as long since according to the computer you didn't start waiting till they rang you out.  The problem with this is that they have 2-3 out of 3 people standing around doing nothing while waiting for the other persons order to finish cooking.  Well they have enough stuff to work on multiple orders at once but they have to know what your order is first.  So instead of standing around doing nothing waiting for the sandwich to finish for the person in front of you they could have gotten started on your nuggets.

The system is designed to ensure they work quickly but it ends up doing the opposite because they are afraid to have the system say you waited for more than 6 minutes (I think that's when the alarm goes off) so instead you wait 3 minutes in line, 3 minutes at the register doing nothing, and then 3-4 minutes waiting for your food.

I only get 30 minutes for lunch and it take me 5 min to get here and 5 min to get back so I usually have less than 10 minutes to eat because they usually make me wait around 10 minutes.

Get rid of the timer! And just do your best."
burger-king-chicago-67,Guadalupe A.,this is absolutely the worst place to eat 18 west jackson blvd mariah is a terrible manager no pop cold fries got on the phone and walked away wouldnt get me the complaint number  to call and omg the 1 800 number does not do follow ups it is listed on closed on yelp and should be absolutely the worst and mariah the manager shame on you
burger-king-chicago-67,Rafael V.,Running any establishment doesn't necessarily mean a good thing. Point and case is this burger king. This place for example is being ran in a nose dive straight into the ground. Tsk tsk tsk.
burger-king-chicago-67,Constance F.,I give this burger King a five star because I've tasted the whopper for the first time and let me just say it was amazing. Very very good! The service at this location is okay and it has some dim lighting but overall it's small and efficient. Food was great when I got some and the veggies on my Sammie were fresh!
burger-king-chicago-67,Sara M.,"Within hours of eating here I ended up on my bathroom floor alternating between vomiting, and laying on the floor thinking back to when I was hospitalized for sepsis and how awful both of these scenarios felt. I spent most of my night vomiting, and now 24hrs later, my body is still trying to get rid of what food I did manage to digest out of my system. I've eaten here before and been fine? But that was months ago. Service was okay, I mean it's fast food the workers aren't there to be best buddies with you. But clearly they need a refresher on food and safety because this is by far the worst food poisoning I've ever had from a fast food restaurant. I won't be coming back to this location. The interior felt dirty, despite this place having only opened I believe last year, but it has the feeling of being a lone burger king that nobody ever goes too and is unkempt. So it's no wonder I ended up with food poisoning I suppose."
soylent-fuchsia-chicago,kira d.,"If your looking for a healthy, local grown, food option, then try Soylent Fuchsia. It's a new supper club style where you buy tickets for a set day and time. Once your there you will enjoy conversing with others, and amazing food. 

I took part in their opening event held at the west end of Chicago. The venue was a beautiful loft and set for 40 individuals. Two hors d'oeuvre were placed out, one was apricot with an almond, and the other was a savory puff filled with parsnip cream. 

Our first course was an Arugula salad with a beet, goat cheese, and a dehydrated tomato slice. The bright sweeter taste of the beet with the creamy goat cheese complimented each other well. 

Second came a striking green broccoli soup that I couldn't resist but to lick the bowl clean. 

Before our main course was served the chef came out, and on a table he spooned out the pallet cleanser. I actually thought it was a dessert because the the mint in it was delicious! 

Out came Tilapia next over a bed of asparagus. The sauce on top of the fish was a lilac colored red wine butter. Everything was cooked to perfection. 

The final main course was (my favorite meat) Pork Tender Loin. It came with chopped potatoes and reddish pink sauce made with Rhubarb, gave the Pork a kick of tartness. 

The first of the two decedent desserts was a refreshing mint infused cake with strawberries, blueberries and ice cream. (yum) 

The finale was a rich chocolate mousse with dehydrated peanut butter. Which went nice with a glass of red wine. 

Not only was the food the best healthy food I've ever tasted, but the community based feeling I had to converse with other like minded individuals left me feeling full by my tummy, and emotionally connected. 
I would recommend for everyone to try!"
