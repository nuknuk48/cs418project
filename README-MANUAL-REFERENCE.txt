Food Inspections for Manual Data Reference Set

I created some python files to parse through the Food_Inspections.csv file found on the 
Chicago Data Portal Datasets archive and I also parsed through a custom file with 40 yelp 
restaurants.
This custom file was made from a subset of the TA data.  We chose businesses alphabetically 
that were food-related to create our list.
Some of these restaurants were closed down and no longer have accurate addresses or records in 
the Food_Inspections.csv, so there are some missing food inspection entries for certain 
group IDs.
